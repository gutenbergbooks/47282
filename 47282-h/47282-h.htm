<p>At the Universal Exposition of 1889, at Paris, France, the best sewing machines of the
world, including those of America, were in competition. They were passed upon by a jury
composed of the best foreign mechanical experts, two of whom were the leading sewing
machine manufacturers of France. This jury, after exhaustive examination and tests,
adjudged that the Wheeler &amp; Wilson machines were the best of all, and awarded the
company the highest prize offered&mdash;the GRAND PRIZE&mdash;giving other companies only
gold, silver, and bronze medals.</p>

<p>The French government, as a further recognition of superiority, decorated Mr.
Nathaniel Wheeler, president of the company, with the Cross of the Legion of Honor&mdash;the most prized honor of France.</p>

<p>The No. 9, for family use, and the No. 12, for manufacturing uses, are the best in the
world to-day.</p>

<p>And now, when you want a sewing machine, if you do not get the best it will be your
own fault.</p>

<p>Ask your sewing machine dealer for the No. 9 Wheeler &amp; Wilson machine. If he doesn&rsquo;t
keep them, write to us for descriptive catalogue and terms. Agents wanted in all unoccupied
territory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>THE NEW HEIR.</small></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>In the summer time, from the door of a darkened
room, a gray-haired, bent old man had just followed a
great surgeon down the wide staircase of Woodlea
Hall.</p>

<p>The surgeon looked around when he reached the last
steps, and there was kindly pity on his grave face as he
met the appealing eyes that were fixed on his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say there is no hope, Mr. Temple,&rdquo; he
said, in answer to the mute inquiry on his listener&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p>Mr. Temple&rsquo;s bowed gray head bent a little lower
when he heard this verdict, and that was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he your only son?&rdquo; asked the surgeon, commiseratingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is our only child,&rdquo; answered Mr. Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;that is sad, but there is no doubt football is a
dangerous game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how long will he be spared to us?&rdquo; now
inquired Mr. Temple with quivering lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will drift away probably during the night, or in
the small hours of the morning. He will not regain
consciousness; the injury to the base of the brain is too
severe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The great surgeon only stayed a few minutes longer
in the grief-stricken household after this, and then was
driven away. And when he was gone, with a heavy
sigh&mdash;almost a moan&mdash;Mr. Temple began to ascend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the staircase, and on the first landing a lady was standing
waiting for him with terrible anxiety written on
her pale face.</p>

<p>Mr. Temple looked up when he saw her, and shook
his head, and as he did this the lady sprang forward and
gripped his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; she asked in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in here, my poor Rachel,&rdquo; he answered gently,
and as he spoke he led her forward into a room on the
landing, the door of which chanced to be open, and
then closed it behind them. &ldquo;My dear&mdash;I grieve very
much to say&mdash;Sir Henry&rsquo;s opinion is not very favorable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice broke and faltered as he said these words,
and a sort of gasping sigh escaped the lady&rsquo;s lips as she
listened to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; she repeated, with her eyes fixed
in a wild stare on Mr. Temple&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he said we must prepare&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! not to lose him!&rdquo; cried the lady with a sudden
passionate wail. &ldquo;Phillip, I can not, I will not!
He was so bright a few hours ago&mdash;so bright and well&mdash;my
Phil, my boy&mdash;and now, now&mdash;it will kill me if
he dies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flung herself on the floor in a frantic passion of
grief before her husband could prevent her, and lay
there writhing in a terrible paroxysm of despair, while
the gray-haired man beside her bent over her, and tried
in vain to comfort or soothe her. She was his wife, but
fully twenty years younger than he was; a handsome
dark-eyed woman, of some thirty-five years, and the
injured boy lying in the darkened room was her only
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; she suddenly cried, raising herself up.
&ldquo;Who murdered him? Which of the boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, it is so difficult to tell in a scramble&mdash;so
difficult to find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will find out!&rdquo; went on Mrs. Temple, passionately.
&ldquo;I do not believe it was an accident; someone must
have struck him on the head. Oh! my boy, my darling!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
she continued, rocking herself to and fro; &ldquo;the one
thing I had to love; the only one that loved me&mdash;must,
must I lose you, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a terrible blow, Rachel&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not try someone else? Do you hear, Phillip?&rdquo;
said Mrs. Temple, now starting to her feet, and grasping
her husband&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Send or telegraph for another
doctor at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, it would do no good,&rdquo; answered Mr. Temple,
sadly. &ldquo;You heard what Doctor Brown said; Sir
Henry Fairfax is one of the first surgeons in town&mdash;and&mdash;he
said there was no hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A wild shriek broke from Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s lips as she
heard this fatal verdict. Her agonized grief was indeed
pitiful to behold. Again and again she repeated that
her boy was the one being that she had to love; was the
only one she loved, and the gray-haired old man sighed
deeply as he listened to her frantic words.</p>

<p>She never seemed to think of his grief, nor even to
remember it. It was her own loss she harped on; her
own misery. But Mr. Temple did not reproach her
with this. He did not say my heart, too, is broken;
the spring of my life is gone. Yet this was so. The
poor lad Phillip Temple, drifting away so fast from life,
had been the center of all his hopes, the pivot of all
his joy. And he, too, was telling himself sadly, as he
listened to his wife&rsquo;s moans, that the boy had been the
only one who had loved him, or who had cared for his
love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She never loved me,&rdquo; he thought, looking at the
handsome grief-stricken woman before him; and as he
did so his memory went back to fifteen years ago;
back to the days when he, the squire, had gone wooing
to the whitewashed parsonage house, and had won the
dark-eyed girl on whom he had set his heart. He had
not asked himself then if her heart was his. She
seemed to like him; she smiled on him and accepted
his presents, and her mother hinted at the advantages
of an early wedding-day.</p>

<p>So they were married, and by and by Mr. Temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
found out his mistake. She had never loved him, and
one morning fell fainting from her chair when she read
the news that a soldier cousin had been killed at some
distant Indian outpost.</p>

<p>And in the days that followed he learnt the truth.
Her cousin had been her lover, but the old hindrance,
want of money, had stood between them, and thus Mr.
Temple had won his wife. She made very little secret
of this to her husband, and did not affect love she could
not feel. Her child became her idol, and from the time
when the baby boy began first to lisp her name she
worshiped him with the whole strength of her passionate,
ill-regulated heart.</p>

<p>The boy, however, had been a bond between the
husband and wife, and they had got on fairly well
together for his sake. They used to talk to each other
of his future, and it was a subject equally dear to them
both. He was a fine, healthy, clever lad of fourteen
when he went out to play football on the fatal day
when he was carried back to his father&rsquo;s house insensible.
He had somehow fallen, and a rush of boys had
swept over him, and when they raised him up he never
spoke again. They took him back to Woodlea Hall;
the village doctor was sent for in all haste, and at once
advised further advice to be telegraphed for. This was
done, and Sir Henry Fairfax arrived from town only to
pronounce the case to be hopeless.</p>

<p>It was a terrible affair, people said, terrible for the
poor mother and for the poor squire, who somehow
was the most popular of the two. Country neighbors
called at the lodge gates, with commiserating inquiries,
while the parents hung over the speechless boy, waiting
in terrible anxiety for Sir Henry Fairfax&rsquo;s arrival.
He came late in the afternoon, and did not stay long.
He carefully examined the unconscious lad, heard what
the country doctor had to say, and then told the father
the truth.</p>

<p>The boy was dying; the little heir to the broad acres
and the old name was about done with earthly things.
It had been a beautiful day; the sun had blazed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
from a cloudless sky on the wide park, the glowing
flower-beds, and the green lawns of Woodlea Hall. It
seemed a mockery; outside so bright, inside so full of
gloom. Still, until Sir Henry Fairfax&rsquo;s arrival, there
had been hope. Doctor Brown, the country doctor, had
spoken of &ldquo;returning consciousness&rdquo; to the anxious
mother. They had watched and waited, however, for
that &ldquo;returning consciousness&rdquo; in vain. The lad lay
white and still, breathing slowly, with closed eyes. He
took no notice of his mother&rsquo;s tender words, of her fond
appeals. He did not hear them, and his bright eyes
were closed to smile no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rachel, my dear, will you leave him any longer
alone?&rdquo; at last Mr. Temple ventured to say, as his wife
wept and moaned, and he laid his hand on her shoulder
as he spoke.</p>

<p>She started and looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say no hope?&rdquo; she asked, wildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Henry said&mdash;&rdquo; faltered Mr. Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there is none for me&mdash;none, none!&rdquo; went on
the wretched woman, in her despair. &ldquo;Why should I
lose everything? Why should God take everything
from me? I have been a good woman for Phil&rsquo;s sake,
and He is going to take him&mdash;all the good that is in
me will be buried in his grave!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, my poor girl; do not talk thus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you understand,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Temple,
yet more wildly, &ldquo;of love like mine? You are old&mdash;you
do not suffer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, God knows I do!&rdquo; cried the unhappy man,
and tears rushed into his eyes, and ran down his furrowed
cheeks as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When George Hill died, I bore it for Phil&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo;
went on Mrs. Temple, regardless, or forgetful, of the
useless pain she was inflicting; &ldquo;and now&mdash;and now,
my darling, my darling, must I lose you, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to him now, at least,&rdquo; urged Mr. Temple;
&ldquo;you would wish to be with him, would you not,
Rachel? There may be some&mdash;parting word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple moaned aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean before he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before he leaves us. Come, my poor Rachel, for
his sake try to compose yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words seemed to have some effect on the
unhappy mother. She made an effort to be calm, and
a few minutes later, leaning on her husband&rsquo;s arm, and
tottering as she went, she returned to the bedside of
the dying boy.</p>

<p>Those standing round it moved back as she approached
it. There were present the village doctor and Mrs.
Layton, Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s mother, and the poor lad&rsquo;s
nurse. No one spoke. Doctor Brown had already told Sir
Henry Fairfax&rsquo;s opinion to the two weeping women, and
Mrs. Layton silently put her hand into her daughter&rsquo;s
as she neared the bed. But Mrs. Temple shrank from
this mark of sympathy. Without a word she fell on
her knees and fixed her eyes on the face of the unconscious
boy.</p>

<p>No wonder she had loved him. He had inherited
her own handsome features, and dark marked brows,
and lithe slim form. But his disposition had not been
like hers. He lacked her waywardness, her excitability.
He had been a sunny-faced, sunny-hearted lad,
and to see him lying thus&mdash;mute, white, and still&mdash;was
inexpressibly painful.</p>

<p>They watched him hour after hour. The sun dipped
behind the green hills that lay to the west, and slowly
the summer daylight began to fade, and still there was
no change. Mrs. Layton crept noiselessly out of the
room to go down to the vicarage to see after her husband
and household, but all the rest remained. The
gray-haired father sat at one side of the bed, and at the
other the mother knelt. From time to time the doctor
felt the small brown wrist that lay outside the coverlet,
and the old nurse by the window was praying silently.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Temple breathed no prayer. In her heart
was hot revolt and despair. She never took her eyes
from her boy&rsquo;s face, and her expression told her
anguish. Once the doctor poured her out some wine,
but she put it from her with a gesture of loathing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>And so the numbered hours stole on. Presently a
new light shone into the room&mdash;a soft pale radiancy&mdash;and
the moonbeams lit the dying face. They fell on
it more than an hour, and then a faint change took
place in the breathing. The doctor bent down and
listened; the father drew a gasping sigh. It was the
passing away of the young soul; and a moment or two
later they were forced to tell Mrs. Temple that she was
childless.</p>

<p>Then the pent-up anguish broke loose. The bereaved
mother caught the dead boy in her arms, and called to
him by every endearing name to come back to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come back, my darling, my darling; do not leave
me alone!&rdquo; she shrieked in her despair.</p>

<p>They sent for her mother, but the very presence of
Mrs. Layton seemed still further to excite her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But for you,&rdquo; she cried, turning on her mother in
her frantic grief, &ldquo;he would never have been born! But
for you I would have been with George&mdash;George Hill,
from whom you parted me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a most painful scene. Mrs. Layton drew the
gray-haired old squire out of the room, and tried to
whisper some words of comfort in his ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grief has made poor Rachel beside herself,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Fancy her talking of George Hill now, when
the poor fellow has been dead over ten years. They
were children together, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mr. Temple made no answer. He knew very
well that his wife was speaking the truth, and that his
mother-in-law was not. He turned from Mrs. Layton
and went into his library, and sat there alone, thinking.
The boy&rsquo;s death had changed everything. Mr. Temple
was a rich man, for besides his own large property, he
had in his youth married for his first wife the daughter
and heiress of Sir Richard Devon, whose estates
marched with his own. At her death this lady had left
everything she possessed to her husband, and thus Mr.
Temple was one of the largest land-owners in the
country.</p>

<p>The old man sighed when he thought of all this, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
covered his face with his hands. He was thinking who
would now come after him; thinking of his heir. He
knew who it must be. The Woodlea estates had been
entailed by his father in the event of his having no
children, beyond him. The late Mr. Temple had left
two sons, Phillip, the heir, and John, who had gone into
the army and died young. But he had married, and left
a son, also named John. This John Temple the squire
knew was now the heir to Woodlea. He was a man of
some thirty years old, and occasionally had visited his
uncle, but no great intimacy had existed between them.</p>

<p>John Temple had a fair fortune, and had not sought
to increase it. He had been educated as a barrister,
but he had never practiced. He had lived a good deal
abroad, and led a roving life, it was said, but his uncle
knew very little about him. He had had in truth small
interest in him. But now all this was changed. His
bright young son, his hope and pride, had passed away,
and the old squire, sitting with his bowed head, knew
that John Temple was his heir.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>THE MAYFLOWER.</small></h2>


<p>Three days later they carried young Phillip Temple
to his grave, and the new heir came to Woodlea as a
mourner. His uncle had written to John Temple to
tell him of the sad and untimely death of his son, and
John Temple had received the news with a little shrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor lad, what a pity, and he was such a fine boy,&rdquo;
he said to the friend who was dining with him, when
the squire&rsquo;s black-edged letter was placed in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this will make a great difference to you?&rdquo;
answered his friend.</p>

<p>It was then John Temple gave the little shrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will give me a good many more thousands a year
than I have now hundreds,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but that will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
about the only difference. The poor lad with his youth
would have enjoyed the old man&rsquo;s money more than
I shall. I am too old to believe in the pleasures of
riches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not, then,&rdquo; replied the friend enviously; &ldquo;you
can buy anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered John Temple, and his brow darkened.</p>

<p>He was a good-looking man, this new heir of Woodlea,
tall and slender, and with a pair of keen gray eyes
beneath his dark brows. He looked also fairly-well
content with life, and took most things calmly, if not
with absolute indifference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been able to pay my way, and what more
does a man want?&rdquo; he said, presently, as his friend still
harped on his new inheritance. &ldquo;To be in debt is disgusting;
I should work hard to keep out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very difficult to keep out of it,&rdquo; was the reply
he received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must cut your coat according to your cloth,&rdquo;
answered John Temple, smiling. &ldquo;Had I lived extravagantly
I should now have been in debt, but I have not,
and therefore I have no duns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What he said of himself was quite true. He had
lived within his income, and was not therefore greatly
elated by learning that he would probably soon be a
rich man. Perhaps he affected to care less about his
change of fortune than he really did. He was cynic
enough for this. At all events he accepted his uncle&rsquo;s
invitation to be present at his poor young cousin&rsquo;s
funeral, and he wrote in becoming and even feeling
terms of the sad loss the squire had sustained.</p>

<p>Mr. Temple read this letter with a sigh, but he was
not displeased with it. He did not show it to his wife,
who was prostrate with grief. Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s condition
was indeed truly pitiable. Her one moan was she had
no one to love her now, and she refused to be comforted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will be better,&rdquo; said Mrs. Layton to the squire,
&ldquo;when it is all over. Rachel is, and always was, very
emotional.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Layton meant that her daughter would be better
when her young son was in his grave. But Mr. Temple
did not consult his mother-in-law on the subject.
He fixed the day for the poor lad&rsquo;s burial himself, and
he invited the funeral guests. And it was only after
John Temple had accepted his invitation that he told
Mrs. Layton that he expected his nephew.</p>

<p>Mrs. Layton went home to the vicarage brimful of
the news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course this young man is the heir now,&rdquo; she said
to her husband; &ldquo;but surely Rachel will have the Hall
for her life? We must see about this, James.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rev. James Layton, an easy-going man, looked
up from the composition of his weekly sermon as his
wife spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say it will be all right,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it may not be; this young man is sure to marry
after the squire&rsquo;s death, and he looks extremely ill
and shaken, and I can not have Rachel&rsquo;s home interfered
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are always looking forward,&rdquo; replied the Rev.
James, pettishly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy, I&rsquo;ve my sermon to finish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sermon can wait, and is of no consequence; but
Rachel&rsquo;s future is. You must speak to the squire
about it at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I consider it would be absolutely indecent, Sarah,
to do so at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine, but the poor old man may take
a fit any day, and then where should we be&mdash;with a
new madam at the Hall, after all Rachel has gone
through?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She always seemed right enough till the poor lad
died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, she married an old man, and should therefore
have the benefit of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, wait until the poor boy is in his grave, at any
rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dilatory as usual! I always said, James, you would
never get on, because you are not pushing enough.
You do not court the bishop like the other greedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
parsons, and just look where you are. At sixty-nine,
in a small vicarage like Woodlea, with under four hundred
a year! You can not expect me to have patience;
and how about poor Rachel? You&rsquo;ll allow this young
man, John Temple, to come down to the funeral, and
perhaps obtain power over a silly old man, and your own
daughter may be left out in the cold! And all because
you won&rsquo;t speak a few words, and insist on the Hall
being settled on her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak yourself,&rdquo; said Mr. Layton, impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would at once, only I know he won&rsquo;t listen to me.
He&rsquo;s got some stupid grudge into his silly old head, and
never consults me about anything. You are the person
to do it, and you must do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go away for the present, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, just like you! Wait till young Temple
arrives; wait until it is too late, and then you will be
satisfied!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having thus reproved her husband at the vicarage,
Mrs. Layton crossed over to the hall for the purpose
of reproving her daughter. And as she entered the
wide domains, and looked around at the luxuries and
beauties of the place, she naturally felt anxious to keep
them in the family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rachel must rouse herself,&rdquo; she mentally reflected,
as she ascended the broad staircase. &ldquo;Now the poor
boy is gone, she has lost a bond between herself and
the old man, and therefore she must exert herself to
keep up her influence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thought this again as she walked along the wide,
softly-carpeted corridor that led to her daughter&rsquo;s
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a nice house!&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;No one must
come here. No interloper; no new squire and his
wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knew that Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s marriage settlement
was everything that was satisfactory. She had seen to
that herself when the gray-haired man had gone courting
her dark-haired girl. She had taken full advantage
of an old wooer&rsquo;s folly, and seen that he paid a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
heavy price for his bargain. But nothing had been
said about the Hall. Then, when the boy was born
nothing naturally was said of it. His mother would
live, of course, with the young heir. But now the
young heir was dead, and some new arrangement must
be made.</p>

<p>Mrs. Layton knew she had no easy task before her,
when she rapped at the door of her daughter&rsquo;s bedroom.
Rachel Layton had been difficult to manage,
but Rachel Temple had developed into a very wayward
woman. As a rule, she was on fairly good terms
with her mother, but she brooked no interference.
Mrs. Layton derived many benefits from her connection
with the Hall. Her mutton, her butter, her eggs,
her vegetables, all came from the same source. The
remembrance of this inspirited her. The Hall must
remain Rachel&rsquo;s, she told herself, cost her what it
would.</p>

<p>It was the day before the poor boy&rsquo;s funeral, and
John Temple was expected at Woodlea early on the
following morning. There was, therefore, no time to
lose. So Mrs. Layton plucked up her courage and
entered her daughter&rsquo;s apartment, determined to speak
her mind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple was standing at one of the windows
gazing listlessly out. She could not rest, and her
handsome face was lined and drawn with her mental
sufferings. She looked years older since her boy&rsquo;s
death, and she glanced round as her mother entered
the room without speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Layton, &ldquo;how are you
feeling now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you ask?&rdquo; answered the unhappy woman,
&ldquo;when everything is ended for me&mdash;that is how I
feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Rachel, this is folly; everything is not
ended for you, and you have, I am sure, many years of
happy life before you yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy life! Very happy life&mdash;alone in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may not always be alone, Rachel, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
come here just now, my dear, especially to speak of
your future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child, yes; you have had a great loss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one knows what he was to me!&rdquo; interrupted
Mrs. Temple, passionately, and she began to wander
up and down the room wringing her hands as she went.
&ldquo;My darling, my boy, and to think that after to-morrow
I shall see him no more&mdash;that they will take away
from me even what is left!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rachel, has Mr. Temple told you that&mdash;his nephew
is coming to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Temple, listlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, then&mdash;Mr. John Temple&mdash;who, of course,
is now Mr. Temple&rsquo;s successor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he coming so quickly to take my darling&rsquo;s place!&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Temple, with a sudden flash of indignation.
&ldquo;But what matter, what matter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a matter, my dear, and it is about this that
I wish to speak to you. When you married, the Hall
was not included in your settlement, as I now see that
it ought to have been, but&mdash;we could not foresee your
sad loss. Now this young man will succeed Mr. Temple,
but he ought not to have the Hall in your lifetime.
That must be secured to you, and before this young
man arrives I think Mr. Temple ought to be spoken to
on the subject, and I should advise you to exert yourself,
my dear, and prevent young Mr. Temple gaining
an undue influence over your husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple fixed her large dark eyes on her
mother&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking of?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am telling you, my dear Rachel, only you do not
seem to attend to what I am saying, that this young
man is coming, who is now your husband&rsquo;s heir, and
naturally he will try to obtain power over his uncle,
which you should not allow. And, as I told you before,
this house is not settled on you, therefore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent, mother, be silent!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Temple
with strong indignation, lifting up her hands. &ldquo;What,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
when my darling&rsquo;s not gone from it yet&mdash;when he is
still under the roof&mdash;you talk of such things! You
always were a wicked, worldly woman, but this is too
much&mdash;too much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her tone and manner frightened Mrs. Layton. &ldquo;I
only meant, my dear&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away, leave me alone!&rdquo; went on Mrs. Temple,
and Mrs. Layton thought it best to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has no common sense,&rdquo; she reflected as she
went back to the vicarage. &ldquo;However, I have done
my duty, and whatever happens I am not to blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in spite of this &ldquo;little disagreement&rdquo; with her
daughter, as she called it, Mrs. Layton did not fail to
appear the next day at the Hall. She went early, &ldquo;as
of course I must see after the sad arrangements,&rdquo; she
told her husband, &ldquo;as Rachel is quite incapable of
doing so, and I consider Mrs. Borridge, the housekeeper,
anything but what she ought to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she interfered in the sad arrangements, and she
saw John Temple, the new heir, arrive with jealous
eyes. She admitted, however, that he was good-looking,
&ldquo;which makes it worse,&rdquo; she mentally added. She
saw also the squire receive him, and introduce him to
the funeral guests as &ldquo;my nephew,&rdquo; with a certain sad
emphasis on the words that Mrs. Layton fully understood.</p>

<p>All the gentlemen in the neighborhood had been
invited, and nearly all arrived at the Hall to follow poor
young Phillip Temple to his grave. The squire of
Woodlea was universally respected, and the guests
looked at his bowed gray head, and grasped his thin
trembling hand with deep sympathy. It was a truly
affecting sight as the slim coffin was borne into the
churchyard followed by the childless old man. As on
the day of the poor lad&rsquo;s death the sun was shining
brightly, and in the pretty spot where they laid him,
green trees were dappling the green grass.</p>

<p>Groups of the villagers stood around to watch the sad
procession, and talk of the dead boy. They had all
known him; he had grown up in their midst, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
tragic accident that had ended in his death had occurred
in a field close to the churchyard.</p>

<p>John Temple stood by his uncle&rsquo;s side during the
service, and he noticed just at its close a girl dressed in
white, and wearing white ribbons, step forward and
approach the open grave.</p>

<p>She was carrying a large white wreath, and her eyes
were full of tears, and she hesitated as if she did not like
to go through the group of mourners around the grave.
She was close to John Temple, and he turned round and
addressed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to place that wreath in the grave?&rdquo; he
said, kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&mdash;&rdquo; faltered the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I place it for you?&rdquo; asked John Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, if you would,&rdquo; she answered, gratefully.</p>

<p>He took it from her hands, and laid it gently and reverently
on his young cousin&rsquo;s coffin. There were many
other flowers, and as John Temple placed hers, the girl
took courage and went up close to the grave and looked
in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was so fond of flowers,&rdquo; she said in a low tone,
and her tears fell fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor boy,&rdquo; answered John Temple, and then he
looked at the girl and wondered who she was.</p>

<p>But the service was over and the mourners turned
away, and John went with them. He glanced back and
saw that the girl in the white frock was still standing
by the grave. Others, too, had now approached it; gone
to take a last look at the young heir.</p>

<p>The funeral guests did not return to the Hall, except
John Temple, who drove there with his uncle. The
squire was deeply affected, and John not unmoved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he was everything to me,&rdquo; faltered the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel the deepest sympathy for you,&rdquo; answered John
Temple, and his words were actually true.</p>

<p>It was a short but dreary drive, and when they reached
the Hall the squire asked John Temple to excuse him
until dinner time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel I am unfit company for anyone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
make yourself quite at home in the house that will be
yours some day,&rdquo; he added, with melancholy truth.</p>

<p>Thus John was at liberty to pass the time as best he
could. He went to the Hall door, and looked out on
the green park. It was a tempting vista. His uncle&rsquo;s
words not unnaturally recurred to his mind. So this
was his inheritance; this wide wooded domain, this
stately mansion house. The son of a younger son, he
had been brought up in a very modest home, and he
remembered it at this moment. It was certainly a great
change, and John Temple thought of it more than once
as he walked straight across the park, and finally reached
a long country lane scented with meadow-sweet, and its
hedges starred with the wild rose.</p>

<p>Temple lit a cigarette, and sat down on a rustic stile.
The whole scene was so rural it half-amused John. The
hayfield near; the cows standing in another field beneath
some trees for shelter from the sun; the distant gurgle
of a brook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It only wants the pretty milkmaid,&rdquo; thought John,
with a smile.</p>

<p>This idea had scarcely crossed his mind when he saw
advancing down the lane the same girl in the white
frock that he had seen by his young cousin&rsquo;s grave.
She was gathering the roses from the hedge rows, and
placing them in a small basket whenever she saw one
that struck her fancy. She was intent on her task, and
never saw Temple seated on his stile until she was
quite close to him. Thus, he had an opportunity of
watching her, as she stretched out her hands to pluck
the flowers.</p>

<p>It was a charming face, fresh, young, and beautiful,
and Temple was half sorry when, with a little start and
a blush, she perceived how near she was to him. He
rose and raised his hat, and the girl looked at him half-shyly,
and then addressed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the gentleman, are you not,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who
so kindly placed my wreath in dear Phil Temple&rsquo;s
grave?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered John Temple, &ldquo;it was very kind of
you to bring one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the girl, quickly, &ldquo;we knew him so
well, you know. He was the dearest boy, and&mdash;and his
death was so dreadfully sad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most sad, indeed; I am truly sorry for his poor
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! it is terrible; terrible for every boy that was
playing in the field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; asked Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were running after the ball, all the boys at
Mr. Carson&rsquo;s school, and Phil, they think, fell, and there
was a rush of boys, and someone must have struck his
head with his foot. No one will say they did, but some
one must. My young brother was playing, but no one
seems to be able to say how it happened. But he never
spoke again; he was unconscious from the first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have cast quite a gloom over the neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been dreadful for everyone; everyone loved
him, and to think now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, his sufferings are over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl raised her beautiful eyes with a look of surprise
to John Temple&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But life is not suffering,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;His life was
all brightness&mdash;but you did not know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did, slightly; he was a fine boy, and I was
very sorry indeed to hear of his death. I am his cousin,
John Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not know; I heard the squire&rsquo;s nephew was
coming&mdash;but of course I did not know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you? Do you live near here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, at Woodside Farm; that white house there,
yonder in the fields.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pointed as she spoke to a long, low house standing
some half a mile distant. As she did so John
Temple looked again at her lovely face. Never in
all his wanderings, he was telling himself, had he
seen one half so fair. The coloring and features
were alike perfect. Perhaps his gaze was too steadfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
for she dropped her eyes and suddenly turned
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must be going now,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I came to get
those roses to make another wreath&mdash;good-morning.&rdquo;
And she bowed and turned away.</p>

<p>Her manner was so simple and dignified that John
Temple felt it would be a liberty to follow her, or try
to detain her. Therefore he turned his footsteps once
more in the direction of the Hall, and on his way thither
he encountered Mr. Layton, the vicar of Woodlea, who
had read the service over poor young Phillip&rsquo;s grave.</p>

<p>The vicar had noticed John Temple among the
mourners; he was a connection of the family, and he
stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have the pleasure of addressing Mr. John
Temple?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered John, touching his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the vicar here; my daughter married your
uncle. Ah&mdash;this has been a sad affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most sad&mdash;can you tell me the name of the young
lady you must have just met?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vicar smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is our village beauty,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they call
her the Mayflower.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>A SAD FLIRT.</small></h2>


<p>John Temple was too much interested on the subject
to be content with such crude information.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Mayflower,&rdquo; he repeated, smiling. &ldquo;What a
pretty name for a pretty girl! But I suppose that is
not her real name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, her real name, for I christened her, and so
should know, is Margaret Alice Churchill, but she was
born in May, and that is how she got her pet name, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She has a lovely face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, she is well-favored, and is a good girl, too,
I believe&mdash;a very good girl. They say young Henderson,
of the Grange, wants to marry her, but this may be
just gossip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s a well-to-do young man, very well-to-do.
His father died about a year ago, and he came into the
family property. It&rsquo;s not a large estate, but a snug bit
of land, and the old man had saved money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite an eligible young man then,&rdquo; said John Temple,
a little mockingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Margaret might do worse. And he&rsquo;s a
nice lad, too; fond of sport and that kind of thing. But
you&rsquo;ll be meeting him, for I suppose now we will often
see you at the Hall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Layton looked at John Temple with slight curiosity
in his mild face as he said this, for he was remembering
the lecture his wife had given him on the subject
of the Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, I am sure,&rdquo; answered John; &ldquo;of
course nothing has been said yet on any such subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, Mr. Temple, you are the direct heir, you know,
to the squire after poor young Phil is gone. I always
understood the Woodlea property was strictly entailed by
the squire&rsquo;s father, on the surviving children of his sons,
and you are now the only surviving child, I believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe there was some such arrangement,&rdquo; said
John, rather repressively. He considered it too soon to
speak of heirs or heirships, and he was getting rather
tired also of the vicar&rsquo;s company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I must be going on my way,&rdquo; he added;
&ldquo;good-day, Mr. Layton,&rdquo; and he touched his hat.</p>

<p>But the vicar was somewhat loth to be shaken off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will meet again at dinner-time; the squire has
asked me to dinner; it&rsquo;s a sad occasion, but these things
must be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not only a sad occasion, but a very tiresome
occasion, John thought, some hours later, when he did
meet the vicar again at the squire&rsquo;s table. And not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
only the vicar, but Mrs. Layton also, who dined
unasked at the Hall. She had indeed spent the day
there, and was not a woman to know there was a meal
going on in her son-in-law&rsquo;s house without joining it.
She, therefore, took her daughter&rsquo;s place at the head of
the table, also unasked, and talked a good deal to John
Temple.</p>

<p>She was a brisk little woman, with a small thin face,
and a sharp tongue. She might have been pretty once
perhaps, when her eyes were not so hard, if that ever
had been. Now she was certainly not pretty, nor sweet
with any womanly grace. She had an eager, watchful
look, as though always on the alert. She was watching
John Temple, as she sat at the squire&rsquo;s table, and talked
to him; watching and speculating as to what he would
do after the squire was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is Mrs. Temple?&rdquo; asked John, in a low tone,
while the vicar was prosing on to the poor squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor dear, what can I say?&rdquo; answered Mrs. Layton;
&ldquo;she was wrapped up in him; yes, wrapped up. I consider
it wrong myself, Mr. Temple, to make an idol of
anything; all may go, all may go! My dear squire,
may I trouble you for a little more of that salmon? It&rsquo;s
delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Layton got her salmon, and ate her green peas
with relish, and all the time went on enlarging about
her daughter&rsquo;s grief. She also tried to extract some
information from John as to his past life, but here she
signally failed. John was reticent and repressive, and
probably, as she remarked afterward to her husband,
&ldquo;he had good reason to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the vicar tells me you met Margaret Churchill
to-day,&rdquo; she said, presently. &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a pretty girl,
but I fear a sad flirt, a very sad flirt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty girls often get that character,&rdquo; answered
John, &ldquo;because men naturally admire them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Layton shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Margaret really goes too far,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now
there&rsquo;s young Henderson of Stourton Grange, an excellent
match for her, and far beyond what she might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
expect. Yet after letting him run after her for months,
and encouraging him in every way, I&rsquo;m told she&rsquo;s
actually refused him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may not like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then why did she seem to like him, Mr. Temple?
Her encouragement was marked, positively marked.
And then there&rsquo;s our curate, Mr. Goodall&mdash;certainly
he is not much in anyway, and has nothing to offer her,
but still she flirts with him. I consider it unwomanly,
degrading in fact, to make so little of herself as to take
up with everyone, yet this is what Margaret Churchill
does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very hard on the pretty Mayflower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, now look at that&mdash;Mayflower indeed! Such
an absurd name. And I&rsquo;m told she always likes to be
called May, but I make a point of addressing her
always as Margaret, the name she was christened by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If ever I have the privilege I shall call her Miss
May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a privilege you will share with a good many
young men, I&rsquo;m afraid, Mr. Temple. Yes, Margaret
Churchill, to my opinion, is a very indiscreet young
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very handsome, at all events.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a way; everything depends on taste, you
know. James,&rdquo; this was to the footman, &ldquo;hand me the
stewed chicken again. Try this entree, Mr. Temple;
it&rsquo;s excellent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple was exceedingly glad when the dinner
was over. Mrs. Layton wearied him to death. She
went into small parish details and squabbles, and gave
the minutest description of her wrongs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A clergyman&rsquo;s wife has many trials, Mr. Temple,
but I try to bear them, and it is such a poor parish,
too. My husband and I have toiled here for over
thirty-nine years, and we barely can live, and certainly
the laborer is worthy of his hire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said John, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And talking of labor, I do not know what the working
classes are coming to,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Layton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
with extraordinary rapidity; &ldquo;I assure you, Mr. Temple,
I can not get a man&mdash;just a common working man&mdash;to
plant and dig my little bit of potato ground, under
half a crown a day! I&rsquo;ve tried a shilling, which I consider
fair, eighteen pence, two shillings, all in vain. It&rsquo;s
absurd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Mrs. Layton talked on, and then, after having
taken two glasses of port wine, she finally withdrew,
&ldquo;to see after my poor dear,&rdquo; she said, alluding to her
daughter. After she was gone John asked leave to go
out on the terrace to smoke, and he breathed a sigh of
relief when he found himself alone.</p>

<p>The terrace ran round one side of the house, and
below it were the gardens. The haze of evening was
lying over the glowing flower-beds, and the dew upon
the grass. It was all so still; the drone of a late reveler
returning from the flowers, the rustle of a bird&rsquo;s wing
among the trees, were the only sounds.</p>

<p>Up and down walked John, thinking of many things.
&ldquo;If this had only happened ten years ago,&rdquo; he was
reflecting; &ldquo;happened when I was young.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not look very old in the soft light, with the
evening breeze stirring the thick brown hair above his
brow, for his head was uncovered. A man in his prime;
a handsome man, and one well-fitted to please a
woman&rsquo;s eyes. Perhaps he knew this, and somehow
his mind wandered to the fair-faced girl he had seen
and admired in the country lane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she is a little flirt, is she?&rdquo; he thought, with a
smile. &ldquo;The pretty Mayflower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name pleased him almost as much as the girl&rsquo;s
beauty had done. She reminded him of the roses he
had seen her gather from the hedge. She was so fresh
and sweet, he thought, and it amused him to hear of
her lovers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she has lovers&mdash;what girl worth looking
at has not?&mdash;but I wonder if she has ever loved,&rdquo; he
reflected.</p>

<p>By and by he began thinking of another woman,
and as he did so he frowned. He began to whistle to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
distract his thoughts, and then suddenly remembered
how lately this had been the house of death. He felt
sorry for the poor mother, with her fresh grief, upstairs;
sorry for the gray-haired old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I should go in and talk to him,&rdquo; he said,
and he did. He found the squire alone.</p>

<p>The vicar had gone home with his wife, and there
was no one in the dining-room but the desolate old
man.</p>

<p>John tried to talk to him, but he found it very difficult.
When two lives have run in completely different
grooves, the conversation is apt to be strained. The
squire had always lived in the country, John Temple
always in towns. They spoke a little on politics, and
John easily perceived his uncle&rsquo;s opinions were opposed
to his own. But he did not intrude this on his attention,
and it was a subject at least to converse on.</p>

<p>They parted on friendly terms for the night, and the
next morning the squire called his nephew into the
library, and spoke to him seriously of his change of
position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is only right that you should have an allowance
out of the estates now, John,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you will
probably so soon inherit them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please do not speak of such a thing,&rdquo; answered
John, with an earnest ring in his voice which pleased
the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must both speak of it and think of it,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;My poor boy&rsquo;s death has been a great shock to me,
and shocks at my age are not easily thrown off. I wish
to feel to you, and treat you now as my heir, and I wish
you to be quite open to me as regards your affairs.
Like most young men I suppose you have debts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; smiled John, &ldquo;I have none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; answered the squire, &ldquo;though
I was quite prepared to pay them if you had. I also
propose to allow you one thousand a year out of the
property, and I hope you will look on this house in the
future as your home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are most kind and generous, uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am simply just; this house, you know, and the
Woodlea property are entailed on you. I have other
property which came to me through my first poor wife.&rdquo;
And here the squire sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why speak of things which must be distressing
to you so soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Things of this kind are always best settled&mdash;life is
so uncertain&mdash;look at my dear boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a very exceptional case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt, but still I wish everything to be arranged
between you and me. I am sorry we have not seen
more of each other, but it is not too late. For the
present you will stay on here, at least for a time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish it, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wish it;&rdquo; then the squire went into further
business details, and John Temple knew that he would
be a richer man some day than he had ever dreamed of.
The squire had saved out of his large rental, and he
had not been communicative to his wife&rsquo;s family as to
the real extent of his income. He disliked Mrs. Layton
exceedingly, and was barely civil to her for his wife&rsquo;s
sake. If she had known the extent of his wealth her
encroachments would have been even greater than they
were, and Mr. Temple considered he had quite enough
of Mrs. Layton as it was.</p>

<p>During this conversation the uncle and nephew were
mutually pleased with each other. And after it was
over John Temple went out for a stroll, and with a
smile at his own folly, turned his footsteps in the direction
of the country lane where he had met &ldquo;the Mayflower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But no pretty girl was to be seen. The lane somehow
looked very empty to John, though the roses were
still blooming on the hedge-rows, and the meadow-sweet
scenting the air. He therefore walked on and on. He
saw a belt of trees in the distance, and he determined
to walk until he reached them.</p>

<p>He found when he did so a wooded hillside with a
gurgling streamlet at its foot. A rustic narrow bridge
spanned the rivulet, and ferns grew on either side of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in great luxuriance. It was a pretty shady spot, with a
winding dell on one side of the little bridge. Along
this John Temple had proceeded a few yards when he
caught a glimpse of something white beneath one of
the trees. He looked again and saw it was a girl sitting
on a camp-stool reading. He drew nearer; the girl
heard his approaching footsteps, even on the mossy turf.
She looked up. It was the Mayflower, and John Temple
felt he had not had his walk in vain!</p>

<p>He stopped when he reached her, and took off his
cloth traveling-cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me addressing you, Miss Churchill,&rdquo; he said,
smilingly; &ldquo;but I have lost my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayflower smiled, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a long way from the Hall,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted a good walk, and now will you tell me
where I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This place is called Fern Dene, and the wood
beyond, up the hill there, is called Fern Wood. It is
famous for its ferns, and there are some very rare kinds
growing about here, and there are also some rare kinds
of moths, but I never can bear to catch them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s better to let them have their lives in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they look so beautiful fluttering about.
But I admit I steal the ferns. This is part of the
squire&rsquo;s property, so you must not tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would doubtless be arrested as a poacher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite so bad as that,&rdquo; laughed the Mayflower;
&ldquo;indeed, I think he knows. Dear Phil Temple,&rdquo; and
her expression changed, &ldquo;often came here with me to
help me to collect them, for I have a fernery at Woodside
of which I am very proud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we could find some now?&rdquo; asked John.
&ldquo;I know something about ferns, and can tell the rare
ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayflower did not speak; in truth she was considering
whether it would be quite proper for her to go
fern hunting with a young man of whom she knew so
little.</p>

<p>Perhaps John Temple saw, or thought he saw, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
reason of her hesitation. He smiled; he looked in her
bright fair face, and then he condescended to a subterfuge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel quite tired with my walk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wonder
if you would think me rude or lazy if I were to sit
down on the turf?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still the girl did not answer, but she smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I?&rdquo; asked John, emboldened by the smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The turf is not mine, but the squire&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered
the Mayflower, still smiling; upon which John flung
himself on the mossy grass not far from her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call this luxury,&rdquo; he said, stretching out his long
limbs. &ldquo;Fern Dene&mdash;so this is Fern Dene? Do you
often come here, Miss Churchill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very often; it&rsquo;s a nice walk from home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you read here. May I ask what you were
reading when I interrupted you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A novel, of course,&rdquo; answered the Mayflower, with
a blush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course; that is only natural.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mayflower looked quickly down at the good-looking
brown face raised to hers, as John Temple said
this, for something in his tone made her think he was
amusing himself at her expense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is only natural,&rdquo; she answered, with a spirit;
&ldquo;I like to read of lives that I suppose are very often
drawn from life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all its tragedies, its comedies, its subterfuges,
and its lies&mdash;it&rsquo;s always the same old story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are some lives in which there are no
tragedies&mdash;nor even comedies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About these, if there be such, there are no stories to
tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just at this moment there appeared coming down the
hill through the trees behind them the stalwart form of
a young man, carrying a gun, and followed by two
dogs. He paused a moment when he saw the white
dress of the Mayflower, and smiled; but in another
moment, perceiving John Temple lying on the grass at
her feet, he frowned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>The dogs ran forward and were approaching the
Mayflower&rsquo;s camp-stool in the manner of welcome and
familiar friends, when their master harshly called them
back, and, hearing his voice, the Mayflower looked
round just in time to see the young man savagely strike
one of the dogs with a whip which he had drawn from
his pocket.</p>

<p>The poor beast yelled and shrank back, and the Mayflower
rose indignantly, her fair face flushing as she
did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Henderson, what a shame!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;What are you striking the poor dog for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man, on being thus addressed, came forward,
and there was a flush on his handsome face also,
as he approached the girl. John Temple did not move;
he lay looking up at two figures before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you strike Juno?&rdquo; repeated the Mayflower,
as the young man drew near.</p>

<p>He raised his cloth cap as he answered, and his brown
eyes fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One must keep them in order,&rdquo; he said, half-sullenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Juno was doing nothing. Come here, poor
Juno; I hate cruelty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you sometimes practice it,&rdquo; retorted the young
man in a low tone.</p>

<p>He was singularly striking looking. Tall and splendidly
formed, with features&mdash;though he was as brown
as a gypsy&mdash;of remarkable regularity. It was indeed
impossible not to remark on his personal appearance.
The one defect on his face, perhaps, was his mouth,
which was sensual looking, though shaded by a thick,
crisp, brown mustache. Still, he was a splendid specimen
of young manhood, and John Temple, from his
vantage ground, mentally, distinctly admitted this.
Yet, in spite of all his physical advantages; in spite,
also, of being undoubtedly well-dressed, there was a
certain countrified look about him which was almost
indescribable.</p>

<p>The Mayflower turned her pretty head away when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
spoke of her cruelty, and his brown eyes followed this
slight movement with unmistakable eagerness. But
she made no answering sign of interest. She looked
down at John Temple lying on the grass, and he rose
as she did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are fond of God&rsquo;s dumb creatures?&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very fond of horses and dogs,&rdquo; she answered;
&ldquo;indeed, I think, of all animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, no doubt, they are fond of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl laughed softly and blushed a little, and then
stooped down and stroked poor Juno&rsquo;s fawn head, who
had once more crept to her side, in spite of her master&rsquo;s
lowering looks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a handsome creature!&rdquo; said John Temple;
&ldquo;and she evidently knows you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; we are old friends,&rdquo; answered the Mayflower,
and she half glanced at the young man she had
called Mr. Henderson as she spoke, but he did not look
pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you like new friends better?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Well, good-morning, Miss Churchill,&rdquo; and once more
touching his cap he strode away, whistling for his dogs
to follow him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the country Adonis?&rdquo; asked John Temple,
smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is called Mr. Tom Henderson of Stourton
Grange,&rdquo; replied the Mayflower, demurely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said John, still smiling. He understood now,
he thought, the cause of Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s clouded brow
and sullen words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a handsome fellow, don&rsquo;t you think, Miss
Churchill?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;People call him good-looking,&rdquo; answered Miss
Churchill, and she cast down her eyes a little consciously.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think he has a nice temper;
fancy him striking the poor dog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he was jealous because she seemed fond of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was very foolish then.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but jealousy is a devouring demon,&rdquo; said John
Temple. &ldquo;But, of course, you never felt it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not believe it, Miss Churchill, though I am
sure you have caused much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again that puzzled look stole over the girl&rsquo;s face.
She could not help feeling as though she knew Mr.
Temple very well, and would like to talk nonsense to
him, and yet she was conscious that perhaps she should
not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know Mrs. Layton, the vicar&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo; now
inquired John Temple, remembering the character she
had given Miss Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and she&rsquo;s such a spiteful old woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s an awful old woman, I think. She bored me
to death last night when she dined at the Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she mention me?&rdquo; now asked the Mayflower,
with a glance of fun in her dark blue eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to tell the truth, she did,&rdquo; answered John
Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she abused me, of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I know she did if she mentioned me. I am
one of her pet aversions. She says all sorts of hard
things about me, and because they call me May at
home she always addresses me as &lsquo;Miss Margaret,&rsquo; as
she thinks it is an ugly name, and I hate it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The vicar told me they called you the Mayflower,&rdquo;
said John, looking earnestly at the girl&rsquo;s lovely face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that is a foolish name,&rdquo; she answered, with a
blush and a smile rippling over her rosy lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is a charming name, and forgive me if
I say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say any nonsense&mdash;at least I mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused here, and blushed more deeply than
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean I have not to pay you any compliments?
What I was going to say is no compliment, but the
simple truth. But I will not tell you even the truth
unless you like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do not care for compliments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not need them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all right then,&rdquo; smiled the Mayflower.
&ldquo;And&mdash;now I must say good-by, Mr. Temple; it is
time I was going home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put out her little hand quite timidly, and John
Temple took it in his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I see you again sometimes?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will
you come here again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;do sometimes come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall hope to see you then. Good-by, Miss
Churchill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took off his cap and stood bare-headed before her,
and as with her light feet the Mayflower turned homeward,
she was not thinking of her lover, young Henderson,
but of the stranger who had just crossed her
path.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>THE OLD LOVE AND THE NEW.</small></h2>


<p>After Mr. Tom Henderson had left the Mayflower
with John Temple in Fern Dene, he walked onward
with a frowning brow and an angry heart. He was
in love with the pretty girl he had just seen sitting with
another man lying at her feet; in love with her, and
jealous of her very words, and moreover he knew who
this other man was.</p>

<p>He had seen John Temple at poor young Phil Temple&rsquo;s
funeral the day before, and knew therefore that
this good-looking, pleasant-tongued man was the new
heir of Woodlea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how on earth did Margaret Churchill pick up
his acquaintance?&rdquo; he asked himself, scowlingly. He
felt savage at the very thought. He was a hot-tempered
man, and had been brought up at home, and
always had had very much his own way at Stourton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Grange. And now he was master there, and had no
small opinion of his own importance.</p>

<p>He knew that in point of family and position he was
a good match for Margaret Churchill. Margaret&rsquo;s
father was a tenant farmer, and Tom Henderson a land-owner,
and he quite appreciated the difference. But
the beauty of the neighborhood apparently did not.
She did not treat the young squire of Stourton as he
expected to be treated, and perhaps this really only
added to her attractions in his eyes.</p>

<p>At all events he felt very angry at seeing her with
John Temple. He walked on with hasty steps, and
never noticed that presently he was followed by a
woman. By and by he came to a field of tall uncut
corn, which was swaying in the summer breeze. Then
she made haste to overtake him. She quickened her
steps, she almost ran, and a few moments later she
called out his name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom!&rdquo; she cried, and young Henderson hearing
her voice turned quickly round, and a dusky flush rose
to his face as he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Elsie,&rdquo; he said, stopping and looking by no
means well-pleased, &ldquo;where have you cast up from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;ve followed you ever so far, Tom,&rdquo; panted the
girl; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting about all the morning trying
to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was wasting your time then, Elsie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t say that, but I could not rest till I saw
you. Why did you not come last night, Tom, as you
promised?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not get away; some one came to the
Grange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ve got something to tell you; something that&rsquo;s
nearly driven me mad, though I know it&rsquo;s nothing but
lies&mdash;oh, yes, I know that, Tom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up in his handsome face as she spoke&mdash;the
half-averted face&mdash;and there was beseeching love
and tenderness in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is this wonderful thing then, Elsie?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Elizabeth Jenkins, and she said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what did she say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s all nonsense, and you mustn&rsquo;t be angry,
Tom&mdash;but she said you often went to Woodside Farm;
that you&mdash;were running after Miss Churchill, in fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flush deepened on young Henderson&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! that I was running after her, was I? Well, I
haven&rsquo;t caught her yet, Elsie,&rdquo; he said, with an uneasy
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t jest about it, Tom, don&rsquo;t laugh; it was a
cruel thing to say&mdash;cruel to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man did not speak; he cast his brown eyes
down on the path; he moved the arm restlessly with
which he was carrying his gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she just said it from spite&mdash;just because
she knew&mdash;&rdquo; continued the girl, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Then Henderson looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does she know, Elsie?&rdquo; he said, glancing at the
girl&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>Her lips quivered and her bosom heaved as he asked
the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What everyone must soon know, Tom,&rdquo; she answered;
&ldquo;what you are and must be to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An expression of great annoyance contracted Henderson&rsquo;s
features.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you mean to say you have talked to this
woman?&rdquo; he said, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not said much,&rdquo; she replied, half-sullenly,
&ldquo;but she knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are a fool for your pains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said this roughly enough, and a sudden rush of
tears filled the poor girl&rsquo;s eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t go on, Tom!&rdquo; she cried, piteously, &ldquo;your
father&rsquo;s dead now; you know you always promised to
marry me when your father died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is folly,&rdquo; muttered Henderson, under his thick
mustache.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is folly?&rdquo; asked the girl, sharply, looking up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This talk about our marriage&mdash;it&rsquo;s an old story,
Elsie, and we may as well drop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The change in her expression was something terrible,
as she listened to these heartless words. She grew
deadly pale, and her whole frame trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop it&mdash;never!&rdquo; she repeated, with passionate
earnestness. &ldquo;Tom, if you hate me now you must
marry me; I will kill myself or you if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good talking folly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not folly; it&rsquo;s truth, as there is a God above us
it is truth! What, after all, after all,&rdquo; and she wrung
her hands, &ldquo;you would go back! But you shall not,
Tom! You may think to throw me over because you
are tired of me, and take up with another girl, but
there are two words to that&mdash;I will go to Miss Churchill
myself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; interrupted Henderson, with a fierce
oath, &ldquo;I will strike you dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t strike me worse than you&rsquo;ve struck me
now, but strike me or not, I&rsquo;ll do what I say unless you
keep your word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood there defying him, with her eyes gleaming
and her hands clenched. She was a handsome woman,
of a certain type, with a clear brown skin and thick,
coarse black hair. She looked also determined and passionate,
and perhaps Henderson was afraid to excite her
further. At all events he moderated his tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t make any more row,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we can
talk it over some other time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it must be settled, Tom; I can&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; she
answered.</p>

<p>An evil look came over Tom Henderson&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are always worrying a man,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
no such wonderful hurry about it, and there&rsquo;s my
mother to consider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always something to consider; first it was
your father, now your mother. But I am to be considered
too, I&mdash;I and something besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson did not speak for a moment; he stood as
though irresolute. Again he looked at the excited face
before him; at the gleaming dark eyes and full quivering
lips, and then he said more soothingly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go home now, Elsie, and keep quiet, and we&rsquo;ll
see what can be done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not going to be put off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must consider things, and see what I think best.
If you go home now I&rsquo;ll come and have a talk with you
to-night at the old place about nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be sure to come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll be sure. And now, good-by, Elsie; you go
your way and I&rsquo;ll go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded to her carelessly, and then turned away,
and the girl stood looking after him as he went. And
there was infinite pain in her expression, infinite
distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he loved me once,&rdquo; she muttered; &ldquo;he loved
me once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words seemed like an epitaph on her life&rsquo;s happiness.
She knew it was all over, and that the young
man to whom she had given so much was weary of
her; weary of the frail bondage by which she held
him.</p>

<p>And, in truth, never was man more weary. Young
Henderson&rsquo;s face was black as night as he strode on
after he had left the girl he called Elsie. She was a
chain around his neck, an intolerable burden, from
which he could see no way to free himself.</p>

<p>And yet he must be free! Margaret Churchill&rsquo;s lovely
face rose before him as he passed down the fields of
waving corn. He would not give her up, he told himself;
he would not let this folly of his almost boyhood
come between himself and his fair love.</p>

<p>He remembered the days when he had first known
Elsie Wray; the days when he used to ride past the
pretty, rather picturesque wayside public house where
her father lived, and where the handsome, motherless
girl occasionally acted as barmaid.</p>

<p>He was just about nineteen when he had first spoken
to her&mdash;a handsome, dark-browned lad&mdash;and, having
been caught in a passing storm, he had taken shelter
at the wayside house. Elsie was about his own age&mdash;perhaps
a year younger&mdash;and these two had drifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
first into a flirtation, and then, on the girl&rsquo;s part at
least, into a deep and passionate love.</p>

<p>It went on for years, always, young Henderson
believed, in secret, on account of his father. The
squire of Stourton was an irascible old gentleman, and
would have allowed &ldquo;no folly,&rdquo; as he would have
called it, between his son and a barmaid. Alas, for
the poor girl! The young, ardent, handsome lover
came night after night in the gloaming, and the two
wandered together in the dewy fields, and sat on the
lone hillsides, and talked of the days when they would
be free to wed, and when there would be no partings
between them any more.</p>

<p>So it went on until, in an evil hour for poor Elsie,
young Henderson saw Margaret Churchill&rsquo;s (the Mayflower&rsquo;s)
fairer face, and his first love-dream was over.
Over for him but not for Elsie Wray, with all its
bitter fruits. She could not believe at first that he
had changed; it seemed impossible, and she so fond.
Then his father died, and her hopes of speedy marriage
revived. But there was always some excuse
from the once ardent lover. It was too soon after
his father&rsquo;s death, his affairs were not settled, and
so on.</p>

<p>And now for the first time she had heard from some
friend that he went to Woodside Farm, and, naturally,
as Miss Churchill was considered the prettiest girl in
all the country round, her jealousy was aroused. She,
however, little guessed how far her false lover had
committed himself with his new love. He had, in fact,
asked Margaret Churchill to be his wife, and though
she had said him nay, he still held determinately to his
purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one and nothing shall come between us,&rdquo; he
muttered, with gloomy emphasis, with his teeth set
hard, as he walked on homeward after his stormy
interview with Elsie. And there was a look on his
face, a dark, savage look, that boded ill for the poor
girl who had loved him too well.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>MRS. TEMPLE.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I can not get that girl&rsquo;s face out of my head,&rdquo; John
Temple thought more than once, as he walked back to
the Hall. Her beauty had indeed a wonderful charm
for him. He had seen and known many pretty women,
but to his mind none so fair and sweet as the Mayflower.
And he liked to think of her by this name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is just like a flower,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Ah!
that such a face should ever fade!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This idea made him more thoughtful. He began to
muse on the brief tenure of earthly things. And as he
approached the stately house that in all probability
would one day be his, he was thinking thus still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may never come here,&rdquo; he thought, looking at the
old Hall, with the summer sunshine falling on its
gray walls; &ldquo;never, nor child of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shadow passed over his face; he struck impatiently
with his walking stick at a tall thistle growing by the
wayside, and there was a cloud still on his brow as he
entered the hall, and went up the broad staircase that
led to the bedroom appropriated to his use.</p>

<p>As he passed down one of the corridors, a tall lady in
black suddenly opened one of the doors and appeared
before him. She was very pale, and her dark eyes
were gleaming as though she were laboring under
strong mental excitement.</p>

<p>She looked at John Temple, and then came out on
the corridor and confronted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have come to take my boy&rsquo;s
place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then John knew at once who she was. This was his
uncle&rsquo;s wife, the bereaved mother, who had lost her
only child. He bowed low, and a look of pity came
into his gray eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have felt very much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for your great
grief.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It has benefited you, at any rate,&rdquo; she answered,
bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not feel it a benefit at such a cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him keenly as he said this, and then
her faced softened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can not tell what he was to me,&rdquo; she murmured
in a broken voice; &ldquo;my only one, my only one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden passion of tears here came to her relief.
Her bosom heaved and her whole form was convulsed,
and John Temple naturally felt exceedingly disconcerted.
He tried to say some consoling words; he
endeavored to take one of her trembling hands. But
the sound of her sobs soon attracted the attention of
someone within the bedroom from which she had come
out. A respectable maid appeared and endeavored to
persuade her to return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, madam! do not give way so,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I was
sure it was a pity you should see&mdash;this gentleman so
soon. But she would see you, sir,&rdquo; she added, looking
at John Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my presence distresses you,&rdquo; said John, courteously,
looking pityingly at the weeping woman, &ldquo;I
shall leave the Hall at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What matter is it, what matter is it!&rdquo; moaned Mrs.
Temple; &ldquo;nothing matters to me now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this she turned away and went back into the
bedroom, and the maid hastily closed the door after
her, and John saw her no more. But the incident
affected him; her grief was evidently so deep and
heartrending; her bitter words to him only the natural
outpouring of her troubled heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor woman,&rdquo; thought John, and he said nothing to
his uncle of this meeting when they dined together in
the evening.</p>

<p>The squire again spoke to John of the property and
his tenants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have improved some of the farm holdings very
much during the last few years,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;at Woodside
Farm especially the whole of the outbuildings
have been renewed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said John, interested, &ldquo;at Woodside Farm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is one of the best farms on the property,
and is let to a very respectable man named Churchill.
Suppose we walk over to-morrow morning, and I will
show you the place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John, nothing loath, at once assented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house is old and somewhat picturesque,&rdquo; continued
the squire, &ldquo;and now that the outbuildings are
in such good order, I consider Woodside a sort of
model place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John expressed himself desirous of seeing it, and he
doubtless was. He had not forgotten that Woodside
was the Mayflower&rsquo;s home, and he wished again to look
on her fair face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There can be no harm in it,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;it is a
very innocent pleasure indeed to admire a pretty girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly at breakfast the next morning he
reminded the squire of his proposition of the night
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that we had to go
over and see some model farm or other this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure, Woodside Farm,&rdquo; answered the
squire, &ldquo;but it had gone out of my head, as things
sometimes do now. I am glad you reminded me of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The uncle and nephew accordingly started together
almost immediately breakfast was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will get there, I think, before Churchill gets
away among his fields,&rdquo; said the squire. &ldquo;I should like
you to see him, for I believe him to be a highly respectable
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a bright, fresh morning, and John Temple
enjoyed the walk. The waving mazes of uncut corn;
the hedge-rows scented with the meadow-sweet; the
cattle standing under the trees, made to his mind a
pleasant picture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, the country is charming,&rdquo; he said, raising
his head as though more freely to inhale the air, and
looking round at the green and fertile landscape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you would not tire of it?&rdquo; asked the
old man by his side, lifting his sad eyes and looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
steadfastly at his nephew&rsquo;s good-looking face. He was
wondering what his life had been; how the last decade
of his thirty years had passed. Not in riotous living he
told himself, for John Temple&rsquo;s features bore no marks
of dissipation nor sin. His eyes were clear and resolute,
his whole bearing that of a man who had led at least a
fairly good life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looks honest,&rdquo; thought the squire, and then he
sighed, thinking of his dead boy, and all the fond hopes
which lay buried in his untimely grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might tire of it,&rdquo; answered John, smiling in reply
to his uncle&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;if I never had any change, for
I think we all want change. It is human nature, part
of our heritage, to desire it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the old man sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must marry now, John,&rdquo; he said, and as he
spoke a flush rose to his nephew&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will think differently I hope, some day,&rdquo; continued
the squire. &ldquo;But here we are at Woodside; it
is a pretty spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was indeed a pretty spot; a long, low, white house,
standing amid a large old-fashioned garden, with trim
box-borders, and fruit trees laden with their ripening
crops. They approached the house from the front, but
at the rear the squire pointed out with some pardonable
pride the new and expensive outbuildings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish every farm on the property was in such good
order,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we will go into the garden, and
I dare say will find the farmer somewhere about, or
perhaps his daughter can tell us where he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke the squire opened the garden gate and
passed down the walks, accompanied by John Temple
and followed by two dogs. A little summer house
stood on the path, and a moment later a pretty scrimmage
ensued. A very handsome gray kitten was disporting
itself at the entrance of the summer house, and
at the sight of the avowed enemies of its race, the kitten
prepared for battle. With tail erected and every hair
on end, it stood to receive the charge it evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
expected. The dogs saw it, and with vicious yells ran
forward, and the brave kitten&rsquo;s moments had been
numbered had not its mistress with a cry sprang forward
from the interior of the summer house and caught
it to her breast. The squire and John called back the
dogs; the Mayflower protected her kitten, and then
stood smiling and blushing to receive her visitors at the
entrance of the summer house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Temple, your dogs frightened me so!&rdquo; she
said, as the squire offered her his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but they have not
touched your kitten, have they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In another instant they would,&rdquo; smiled the Mayflower,
holding her pet tightly in her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pretty creature it is,&rdquo; said John Temple,
now stroking the kitten&rsquo;s striped head, whose large eyes
were wide open with terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t he a beauty?&rdquo; answered the Mayflower.
&ldquo;Poor Jacky! and would the naughty dogs have eaten
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jacky looked as if he decidedly thought that they
would, and clung to his mistress&rsquo; white frock, who
soothed and comforted him. The Mayflower certainly
was a lovely creature as she stood thus, with her fair
head uncovered. She had been sewing in the summer
house; trimming a white straw hat, and ribbons and
flowers lay strewn about, and as a man of taste John
Temple found it impossible not to admire so pretty a
picture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is your father in the house?&rdquo; now asked the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was in the garden five minutes ago, looking at
the apple trees,&rdquo; replied the Mayflower. &ldquo;Shall I call
him, Mr. Temple?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at this moment Mr. Churchill, the farmer, was
seen advancing toward them, as he had heard in another
part of the garden the squire and John Temple calling
back their dogs, and now came to see what was the matter.
He took off his low-crowned hat when he recognized
the squire, but Mr. Temple held out his thin hand
to his favorite tenant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Churchill, how are you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
have brought my nephew to see you; my nephew&mdash;and
now my heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice faltered a little as he said the last few words,
and a look of respectful sympathy passed over the
farmer&rsquo;s brown face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glad to make your acquaintance, sir,&rdquo; he said, looking
at John Temple with a pair of very intelligent gray
eyes.</p>

<p>Altogether he was a good-looking man, and was, moreover,
an excellent farmer. He had gone with the times,
and instead of grumbling at the price of corn and foreign
competition, grew on his land the crops he found
to sell best. He was a great breeder of horses also, and
his stud was quite a famous one. He was also a keen
man at a bargain, and prosperous. He had married a
lady in a superior social position to himself, whom he
had won by his good-looking face, and he had given his
only daughter Margaret Alice Churchill (the Mayflower)
an excellent education. Mrs. Churchill had died two
years ago, but as yet he had taken no second wife, so
May, as she was always called at the farm, was the mistress
of the house.</p>

<p>He had two other children, both schoolboys, and
Willie Churchill (the second boy) had been one of the
players in the fatal game of football when poor Phil
Temple, the little heir of Woodlea, had met his death.
The squire knew this fact, but no particular blame had
been laid on the boy. A rush had taken place, and the
little heir had fallen, and it was said to be impossible to
tell who had given the actual kick or blow that had
destroyed Phil Temple&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it will interest my nephew to have a look at
your stud,&rdquo; continued the squire; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s lived mostly in
towns, and knows nothing of farming, I dare say, but
horses interest nearly all men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; answered Mr. Churchill. &ldquo;But won&rsquo;t
you come in, gentlemen, and rest awhile first, and have
a glass of claret, or a taste of our home-brew or cider?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The squire accepted the farmer&rsquo;s offer, and said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
would have a glass of the home-brewed ale, as he knew
it of old. He therefore walked on toward the house,
accompanied by Mr. Churchill; and May Churchill, still
carrying her kitten, followed the two, with John Temple
by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was quite glad when my uncle proposed to come
here to-day, Miss Churchill,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I wanted to see
your pretty home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very welcome,&rdquo; answered the Mayflower,
with such a charming grace of manner that John Temple
could not help wondering where she could possibly
have acquired it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must show me your fernery,&rdquo; he continued;
&ldquo;and,&rdquo; he added hastily, for they were now nearing the
house, &ldquo;will you come one day to Fern Dene, and let
me try to find some rare ones for you? Will you
come to-day&mdash;this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>May blushed to her pretty white brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This afternoon?&rdquo; she repeated with hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, why not? It is fine; promise to come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said May, and as she spoke her father
turned round and addressed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;give me the cellar keys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At three o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; remarked John Temple in a low
tone, but May had heard the words.</p>

<p>She hurriedly entered the flower-festooned porch of
the house, which opened into a long low hall with windows
on either side of the door, which also were filled
with flowers.</p>

<p>The whole place, indeed, had an air of comfort and
refinement, and the dining-room into which Mr.
Churchill ushered the squire and John Temple was not
only substantially but handsomely furnished. A rich
turkey carpet lay on the polished oak floor, and the sideboard
and mantel-piece were of carved oak. John Temple
looked around with astonishment. He had pictured
a tenant-farmer&rsquo;s house to be so very different. For,
from the silver flagon in which a neat hand-maiden
bore the home-brewed ale, to the fair young daughter,
everything at Woodside was of the very best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>May Churchill lingered in the room a few minutes, and
then when the squire began to talk of the stud and their
accommodation, she went out, and John Temple saw
her once more enter the garden. But he did not see her
again during his visit to the farm. The farmer was
intent on his different breeds of horses, and had made
a good bargain with the government during the last
months for mounts for the troops. John got a little
weary, it must be confessed, to all this, but the squire
was interested. John was thinking of the sunny garden
not far away, and wishing he was wandering with fair
May among the flowers. However, he made no sign of
this. He left Mr. Churchill with the impression that
he was a sensible, well-bred young man, and likely to
make a good landlord, and this last idea was an important
point to Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>The uncle and nephew left Woodside in time to be
back to the Hall for lunch, and when they entered the
dining-room, to their great surprise they found Mrs.
Temple awaiting their arrival.</p>

<p>It was the first time that she had been down-stairs
since her boy&rsquo;s death, and the squire went forward with
some emotion, and took her hand when he saw her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am very glad you are able to
come down to-day&mdash;this is John Temple, my nephew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John bowed low, and Mrs. Temple fixed her dark
eyes on his face, but did not speak, or make any allusion
to their meeting on the corridor the day before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have had a long walk,&rdquo; continued the squire, a
little nervously, &ldquo;and you must be hungry, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please sit down, then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple, still looking
at John with her restless eyes, and waving him to
take a seat at the table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine day outside, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A charming day,&rdquo; answered John. &ldquo;Do you think
you will feel well enough to venture out a little?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I am weary of being
indoors. I feel as if I can not breathe, and yet to go
out so soon, so soon&rdquo;&mdash;and she covered her face with
her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My love, I entreat you not to agitate yourself,&rdquo; said
the squire, yet more nervously.</p>

<p>She took her hand from her face; her eyes were dry
and hard, and she smiled a bitter smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean to make a scene,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
meant to be as if nothing had happened&mdash;as if I had
still something to live for. I apologize to you, Mr.
Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again John bowed low his comely head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you could understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how deeply
and truly I sympathize with your grief&mdash;I do, indeed,
Mrs. Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was the ring of truth in his voice; the gleam
of truth in his gray eyes, and Mrs. Temple seemed to
understand this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not let us speak of it,&rdquo; she said, and as she spoke
she seated herself at the table. &ldquo;Now, tell me where
you have both been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been over some of the farms,&rdquo; answered
the squire, hastily, and John understood that for some
reason or other he did not wish to speak of their visit to
Woodside to his wife.</p>

<p>But John was an easy conversationalist, and the lunch
hour passed not unpleasantly. After it was over Mrs.
Temple rose, restlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me into the garden for a short time,&rdquo;
she said, addressing John; &ldquo;it will occupy my mind a
little to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be most happy,&rdquo; he answered, and for the
next half-hour he walked up and down the garden
walks with his uncle&rsquo;s wife. She was evidently trying
to keep herself under control, but occasionally she grew
excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have thought me mad yesterday,&rdquo; she
said once, &ldquo;to waylay you as I did. But I felt so restless
to see you; I hated you, you know, because&mdash;because
you had come to take my darling&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will not hate me any longer,&rdquo; replied
John, gently.</p>

<p>She looked at him searchingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I do not think I shall. But bear
with me for a little while, for I have suffered so much.
Mine has been a life of suffering,&rdquo; she added, impetuously.
&ldquo;No one knows, none but my own heart, what
I have gone through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all suffer at times, I believe,&rdquo; answered John,
gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But men do not suffer as women do,&rdquo; continued
Mrs. Temple, excitedly. &ldquo;Men can go out into the
world, can fight, can struggle, while we sit breaking our
hearts at home. But why speak of it? Anyone can
tell what my life has been&mdash;look at my marriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my uncle is most devoted to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A young woman married to an old man! Take
my advice, Mr. Temple, don&rsquo;t marry an old woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a harsh little laugh as she said this, and it
jarred on John&rsquo;s ears. He grew restless to go away. It
must be nearing three o&rsquo;clock, he knew, and he wanted
to be in the woods at Fern Dene, with someone who
was fresh and fair, not like this dark, handsome, spirit-torn
woman. And with quick intuition Mrs. Temple
perceived this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are tired of me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I am getting
tired of you. Good-by for the present; we will meet
again at dinner;&rdquo; and with this she nodded and turned
away, and John was free to follow his own inclinations.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>CRUEL WORDS.</small></h2>


<p>What these inclinations were we may easily guess.
To walk as quickly to Fern Dene as possible, yet when
he arrived there he found that May Churchill was just
preparing to go home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not come before,&rdquo; he explained, hastily;
&ldquo;my uncle&rsquo;s wife took into her head to go into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
garden, and asked me to go with her, and what could I
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Mrs. Temple!&rdquo; said May, pityingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, she is greatly to be pitied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her loss was terrible, most terrible. Phil was such
a dear, bright boy, and to die unconscious, as he did,
must have nearly broken his mother&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo; inquired John Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little; merely through things connected with the
schools and the church, you know. I used to teach at
the schools once,&rdquo; added the Mayflower, with a smile
rippling over her rosy lips; &ldquo;but Mrs. Layton made
herself so disagreeable that I left off, and since then I
have been one of her black sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I shall be one of her black sheep, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has its disadvantages though, I assure you. If
you have any little peccadillos or failings, Mrs. Layton
will find them out and preach them on the housetops,
unless you are in her good graces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure you have neither peccadillos nor failings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask Mrs. Layton,&rdquo; laughed May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Layton&rsquo;s opinion would never change mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are stanch to your friends,&rdquo; said May,
looking at him with her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I shall always be stanch to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May laughed and turned away her head, and John
saw the white throat color and the lovely bloom on her
smooth cheeks deepen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are forgetting the ferns,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we are; tell me the best place to find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She led him up a green arcade, through which a
shallow stream went bubbling on. By the marge of the
water strong, hardy ferns were plentiful, but these were
principally of the larger kinds. But here and there in
little mossy dells, the rarer fronds in their delicate
greenery grew, and John Temple, pen-knife in hand,
was speedily engaged in cutting them from the earth.
The Mayflower stood by his side, while John knelt on
the ground, and John felt conscious that the situation
was a dangerous one. Alone in the woods with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
beautiful girl, kneeling practically at her feet! Yet he
felt wonderfully happy. His years seemed to roll back;
he was a youth again, with all the hopes and aspirations
of youth.</p>

<p>He looked up at the fresh, bright face bending over
him, and he forgot many things that he ought to have
remembered. As for May Churchill she also felt perfectly
happy. She had never known anyone she liked
half so much as Mr. Temple, she was thinking. &ldquo;And
he is so good-looking, too,&rdquo; pretty May also reflected,
glancing down on John&rsquo;s brown head.</p>

<p>These two, in truth, were fast drifting into that dangerous
stream where too often lives are wrecked and
hearts are broken. Standing on the marge the golden
tide flows by, and we only see the shining surface, not
the rocks below. But sweet are these hours; sweet the
dawn, the dream, of joys to come! The dawn may
cloud, the dream be broken, but the coming shadows
seem far away.</p>

<p>It was only the early dawn for John and May.
Neither of them, indeed, had for a moment reflected
that this meeting would make any difference in their
lives. Feelings are strange and subtle, and creep in
unawares to the human heart. They only both felt
very happy, and the world seemed very bright. Bright
to them, and dark and black to jealous eyes watching
them from the higher ground above.</p>

<p>These jealous, fiery brown eyes were those of young
Henderson of Stourton Grange. He had hoped to meet
May Churchill during the afternoon in Fern Dene, as
she often went there, and to his rage, when he arrived
at the crest of the hill above the Dene, he saw May
again with John Temple.</p>

<p>He could see John look up in her face, as he knelt on
the ground, and May look down and smile on his.
Henderson had gone to the Dene in a most unhappy
and unsettled state of mind, and this sight seemed to
half-madden him. His brow grew black as night, and
a bitter curse broke from his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if I swing for it, this shall not be,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he thought darkly of his interview with Elsie
Wray the night before, and now this girl stood as an
obstacle in his way. He had not dared openly to refuse
to marry her, yet he never meant to do so. He feared
her; she might fulfill her threat, and write or go to May
Churchill, and then he knew that in that case all hope
of winning May was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must try to get her to go away,&rdquo; he thought,
frowning and knitting his black brows. &ldquo;But then
there&rsquo;s that confounded old fool, her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was certainly a miserable enough position in which
he found himself. Bound by his honor, by a hundred
promises, to marry one woman, and passionately in love
with another! He stood mentally cursing his folly, his
fate, and the unhappy girl who had trusted him too
much. But give up May he would not. There was a
dogged obstinacy about this young man; the sullen,
unreasonable obstinacy of a low order of mind, and
when once he had determined on a thing nothing would
turn him from his purpose.</p>

<p>So gnawing his thick, red underlip beneath his brown
mustache, and grinding his strong white teeth in his
wrath, he watched the two below dallying on the green
sward. He did not seek to interrupt them. He had
already learnt to hate the smiling indifference of John
Temple&rsquo;s manner to him, and he knew he could not
rely on his own temper. No; he saw them arrange the
ferns they had got in May&rsquo;s little basket; he saw them
stand side by side, looking at the bubbling stream, and
then he watched them leave the Dene and cross the
rustic bridge which led to it.</p>

<p>They were still together when he lost sight of them,
and then he turned homeward, with a gloomy brow
and an angry heart. As he strode on, various plans
crossed his brain. But of one thing he was determined.
Cost what it might, he would get rid of Elsie Wray.</p>

<p>As he neared Stourton Grange, a substantial square
stone house, standing in an extensive well-kept garden,
he encountered a tall, good-looking lady in deep mourning.
This was his widowed mother, and Tom Henderson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
was her only son. Her face brightened when she
saw him, and she put out her hand when she met him,
and laid it on his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, how lucky that I should come upon you,&rdquo;
she said, smiling affectionately.</p>

<p>Young Henderson&rsquo;s smile in return was a somewhat
forced one, and her fond eyes instantly perceived this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something is worrying you, Tom,&rdquo; she said, quickly.
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom did not speak; something was worrying him,
more than worrying him, but it was not a thing he
could exactly tell his mother.</p>

<p>She looked up fondly into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;can I help you in anything?
I am sure there is something wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; he answered abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Tom? Surely you can trust your
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t tell you about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said this very impatiently, and Mrs. Henderson
looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it about some woman, Tom?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Tom replied by a sort of a groan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would marry, Tom,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
Henderson, earnestly. &ldquo;Many mothers don&rsquo;t wish their
sons to marry because they say it takes them away from
themselves, but I don&rsquo;t feel this. Your happiness would
be mine. Tom, a little bird has whispered to me that
you run after a certain very pretty girl; is this true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean May Churchill?&rdquo; answered Tom Henderson;
&ldquo;well, I certainly do admire her very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;are you engaged to her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; there are always worries in the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not surely&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, I may as well tell you that I have made a
fool of myself, but I must get out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Tom&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! don&rsquo;t talk of it like a good old woman; I&rsquo;ll
get out of it, that I&rsquo;m determined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson did not say anything more. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
walked on with her hand through her son&rsquo;s arm, feeling
very anxious. Tom Henderson had been a wayward
boy, and he was a wayward man, and his mother was
conscious perhaps that she had spoilt her only child.
She had heard a rumor&mdash;got one of those painful hints
which friends do not scruple to give&mdash;about her son&rsquo;s
connection with Elsie Wray of the Wayside Inn. But
she had never spoken of it to Tom. She was a delicate-minded
woman, and extremely attached to him, and
there were subjects on which Mrs. Henderson felt she
could not speak to her boy.</p>

<p>The mother and son walked home together and then
parted, Mrs. Henderson to see after some household
arrangements, Tom to retire to his own room to write
a letter to Elsie Wray.</p>

<p>Let us look over his shoulder as he sat, pen in hand,
with his black brows knitted and his handsome face
distorted with the angry passions in his heart. He
began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Elsie,&rdquo; and then paused. He did not in truth
know what to say. He knew he was acting shamefully,
but he told himself it was folly to sacrifice the happiness
of his whole life because a foolish girl had loved
him too well.</p>

<p>Again he began &ldquo;Dear Elsie,&rdquo; on a fresh note-sheet,
and this time continued his letter:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Elsie</span>: Our interview of last night was very
unsatisfactory, and I want to see you again, and I hope
we will come to some lasting agreement. I am quite
willing to come down handsomely for any supposed
wrong I may have done you, and I hope you will act
like a sensible girl and accept my proposition. Will
you meet me to-night at nine o&rsquo;clock, on the ridge
above Fern Dene? It&rsquo;s a quiet place, and we can have
our talk out there without being interrupted as we
were last night. There is always someone about near
your house, seemingly. But do act sensibly, and don&rsquo;t
make a row about what can not be helped now.</p>

<p class="signoff">&ldquo;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;T. H.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>He finished this letter, and then put it in his pocket
and walked to the stables, and gave it to his groom.
This man was engaged rubbing down a horse when his
master appeared, and he seemed quite accustomed to
receive such missions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take that over to Miss Wray, Jack,&rdquo; said young
Henderson; &ldquo;make some excuse&mdash;have a pot of beer
or something&mdash;but give it into her own hands, and no
one else&rsquo;s, and here&rsquo;s a shilling for the beer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, master,&rdquo; answered Jack, pocketing the
note and the shilling with something between a grin
and a nod, and then touching his forelock. &ldquo;Must I go
directly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Henderson, and then he turned away,
and went whistling out of the stables with his hands in
his pockets.</p>

<p>Upon which Jack took a rough towel and rubbed
his own face and hands, and otherwise improved his
appearance, and then started off on his way to the wayside
public house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The game&rsquo;s nearly up,&rdquo; he thought, with another
grin, as he went shambling on. &ldquo;Miss Elsie will ha&rsquo;
to look a bit lower than the young master before she&rsquo;s
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He speedily arrived at his destination. It was a
pretty spot&mdash;this wayside house, with its trellised
walls, covered with creepers and roses, and its open
porch. In the porch the master of the house, James
Wray, was sitting smoking a long white pipe, and he
took it from his mouth and nodded in a friendly
manner when the groom from Stourton Grange
appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jack, my lad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and how are ye all
at the Grange?&rdquo;</p>

<p>James Wray was not unaware of the intimacy of his
daughter with the young owner of the Grange, or without
his private hopes that some day he might see Elsie
the mistress there. He therefore made room for Jack,
the groom, to take a seat beside him in the porch, but
this did not suit Jack&rsquo;s views.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m that dry I must ha&rsquo; a
drop o&rsquo; beer first, and I&rsquo;ll go in and get it, and then
come out and ha&rsquo; a bit crack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlord nodded his head and resumed his pipe,
and Jack entered the house. Two or three men were
sitting drinking, and a good-looking smart girl was acting
as barmaid, but Elsie Wray was not visible. Jack
looked around, called for his beer, but had a word to
whisper in the barmaid&rsquo;s ears as she was serving it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the young missis?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in the parlor, I think, Mr. Impudence,&rdquo;
answered the smart barmaid, tossing her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her one of the lads fra&rsquo; the Grange wants a
word wi&rsquo; her,&rdquo; said Jack, winking one eye, upon which,
with another toss of the head, the barmaid vanished;
and a few moments later Elsie Wray, who looked pale,
agitated, and handsome, appeared.</p>

<p>Jack touched his forelock and went up to her, and
produced Tom Henderson&rsquo;s letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young master sent this for you, miss,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Elsie put out a shapely brown hand and eagerly
caught at the letter, and then without another word
retired with it and ran hastily upstairs to her own little
bedroom to read it.</p>

<p>When she got there she tore it open with trembling
fingers, and, as her eyes fell on the insulting words it
contained, the poor girl turned deadly pale, and staggered
back as if something had struck her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare he! How dare he!&rdquo; she cried aloud, in
sharp bitter tones of anguish.</p>

<p>Again she read the cruel words. She stared at them
as though they burned into her brain, and then with
sudden passion she flung the letter on the floor and
trampled it beneath her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The coward! The base coward!&rdquo; she muttered.
&ldquo;So he would buy me off, would he? Me! But he shall
see; he shall see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She began to pace up and down the room after this,
evidently revolving some question in her mind. Then
she suddenly remembered that the groom from Stourton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
would probably be waiting for an answer. And
with her eyes flashing, and her head thrown back, she
returned to the bar in the room below.</p>

<p>Jack was still sitting there drinking his beer, and he
rose when Elsie appeared.</p>

<p>Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation she went up to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; she said, in concentrated tones of suppressed
anger and passion, &ldquo;that I will be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all; without another word she turned and
left the bar, and the men sitting there looked at each
other as she did so. The expression of her face was so
tragic that it seemed to forebode evil. Jack Reid&mdash;the
groom&rsquo;s surname was Reid&mdash;said nothing. He looked
rather frightened, and shortly afterward left the Wayside
Inn, declining the offer of the landlord, who was
still sitting on the porch, to remain any longer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in her room upstairs Elsie Wray was in a
state of mind bordering on distraction. All the hopes
of her future life seemed dashed to dust. But with
hard-set teeth she told herself that she would not give
in. Tom Henderson must keep his word and marry
her, even if he never spoke to her afterward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or he or I shall die for it,&rdquo; she muttered with bated
breath.</p>

<p>Then she stole to her father&rsquo;s room, and from a
locked cupboard there drew out a loaded revolver.
Elsie, a favorite daughter, and one whom he completely
trusted, always kept the landlord&rsquo;s keys.</p>

<p>Having thus secured the weapon, about two hours
later she started with a determined heart to keep the
tryst that Tom Henderson had given her.</p>

<p>By this time a fitful moon had risen, the light being
constantly obscured by drifting clouds. It was a wild-looking
night, and seemed to suit the mood of the
unhappy woman who went out to meet her false lover
under such cruel circumstances.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>THE LAST TRYST.</small></h2>


<p>Before Elsie Wray quitted the Wayside Inn, however,
she had a word to say to the young barmaid who
had brought her the message that the groom from
Stourton Grange wished to speak to her.</p>

<p>She beckoned this girl to her, who was officiating at
the bar, and whispered a few words to her in the passage
outside the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am going out, but don&rsquo;t tell
father. Say, if he asks after me, that I have gone to
bed with a bad headache. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The barmaid nodded; she quite understood that her
mistress was going out to meet the young squire from
Stourton Grange. This affair was known and had been
much commented on by the small circle round the inn-keeper&rsquo;s
family. Some had shaken their heads over it,
and wished it might end well. Others took a more
charitable view. But Alice, the barmaid, had seen the
look in Elsie&rsquo;s face when she had given her message to
Jack Reid the groom, and her expression did not bode
well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be late, mistress?&rdquo; whispered the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Elsie, in a low, slow tone, and she
clutched the revolver she held beneath her cloak yet
harder as she spoke. &ldquo;I will go out by the back door,&rdquo;
she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch till you come back,&rdquo; said Alice, and Elsie
nodded and then glided away into the darkness, and
the barmaid looked after her for a moment, but was
quickly recalled to her duties by her master&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>Elsie having quitted the house and closed the door
softly behind her, passed down through the kitchen
garden, and speedily found herself on the high road.</p>

<p>She had a long walk&mdash;at least two miles and a half&mdash;before
she could reach the high land that lies above
Fern Dene. Stourton Grange stands about a mile to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the west of Fern Dene, and once or twice in the early
days of their love, Elsie had met young Henderson in
the Dene. But this was before Henderson had discovered
that this shady and romantic spot was the
favorite walk and resort of pretty May Churchill. After
this there were no more meetings in the Dene with his
lowly-born sweetheart. Henderson chose another direction,
and ran no risks of encountering May Churchill
while walking with Elsie Wray.</p>

<p>Now swiftly and silently beneath the drifting clouds
the forsaken woman went on to what Henderson meant
to be her last tryst with him. She never looked up nor
around. She knew the way well, and every feeling of
her heart was concentrated on one object.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall die unless he does me justice,&rdquo; was the
thought that entirely possessed her. She was desperate,
and in her desperation she was capable of anything.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Tom Henderson was feeling anything
but comfortable. The groom, Jack Reid, had
returned and had given Elsie&rsquo;s message to his young
master, and added what he called a hint of his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looked mortal bad,&rdquo; he said, significantly.</p>

<p>Tom Henderson whistled, but he by no means liked
the prospect before him. He drank more wine at dinner
than was his wont, and his mother again and again
looked at him anxiously. She did not like his restless
movements, his somewhat disjointed words. At last
he rose and said he would go out for a smoke and a
stroll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be late, my dear,&rdquo; answered his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, and then she watched him walk
down the avenue till the red tip of his cigar disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<p>He went on slowly enough. He knew he was going
to meet an angry, disappointed woman, and he knew
he had done Elsie the worst wrong a man can do, yet
he never swerved from his purpose. But he wished it
was over; he was essentially selfish, and he was thinking
of his own feelings of discomfort and not of the
poor girl&rsquo;s, as he went on through the gusty night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently he came to the ridge of high land above
Fern Dene. This is rather a remarkable piece of
ground; the dip of the hill from it down to the Dene
being exceedingly steep, even precipitous. This descent
is thickly studded with trees, brambles, and undergrowth.
On the ridge there is a narrow walk, with the
fall of the hill on one side and stretching fields on the
other.</p>

<p>Along this walk Henderson went, still slowly, and as
he did so the moon suddenly broke forth from the drifting
clouds, and showed him dark and distinct the figure
of a woman on the pathway before him.</p>

<p>It was Elsie Wray wrapped in a long cloak, and
standing on the very verge of the descent below, gazing
down into its gloomy depths. Henderson could see her
face in the moonlight; could see the sharply cut profile
and the black brows, for the hood of her cloak had fallen
back, and her head was uncovered. She looked a weird
and tragic figure in this lonely spot, and for a moment
Henderson hesitated to approach her. Then he pulled
himself together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be done,&rdquo; he told his sinking heart, and he
therefore began to walk more quickly forward, and at
the sound of his footsteps Elsie turned her face away
from the ravine and looked around.</p>

<p>But she made no forward movement to meet him.
She stood there awaiting his approach, silent, motionless,
and something in her attitude made Henderson
yet more uneasy.</p>

<p>At last he neared her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Elsie,&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid you&rsquo;ve had a long walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not answer, nor did she attempt to take his
proffered hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked you to come here, Elsie,&rdquo; continued Henderson,
somewhat hurriedly and nervously, &ldquo;because I
want to have a good talk with you. I want in fact to
make some arrangements, some permanent arrangement.
You see all that talk about our marriage is
nonsense. I&rsquo;ve others to consider, my mother to consider,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and a marriage between us would never do, that&rsquo;s
a fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you first learn this fact?&rdquo; asked Elsie,
bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, I was only a lad when I first knew
you, Elsie, and lads do and say a lot of foolish things.
But I want to make it all square and act handsomely,
as I told you in my letter, if you will only be a sensible
girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how much do you propose to buy my silence
for?&rdquo; said Elsie, yet more bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it&rsquo;s no use speaking in that tone. I mean
to do what I say, and settle enough on you to make you
comfortable for life. Why not emigrate, and you could
marry some fellow out there with the money I give
you? I thought of even as much as two thousand
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for ten hundred thousand pounds!&rdquo; cried
Elsie, raising her voice in passionate accents. &ldquo;Not
for all the money that was ever coined, Tom Henderson!&rdquo;
she went on. &ldquo;What do you take me for? Do
you think I would sell my rights, the rights of my
unborn child? Never! You must marry me, or you
will rue the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not marry you,&rdquo; answered Henderson, doggedly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s impossible for a fellow in
my position to do so? How can I take a wife from a
public house? You should look at things more sensibly,
Elsie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have thought of all this before&mdash;before
it was too late. Now it is. If not for my sake, for the
sake of the child&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother the child!&rdquo; muttered Henderson,
brutally.</p>

<p>The face of the woman he addressed turned absolutely
livid. Her eyes dazed, her breath came short,
and her hand convulsively grasped the revolver hidden
beneath her cloak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall not be the child of shame,&rdquo; she cried in a
low fierce tone. &ldquo;If you do not promise to do me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
justice, Tom Henderson, as sure as there is a God
above us I will shoot you dead first, and then myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lifted the revolver as she spoke, and Henderson
saw the gleam of steel in the moonlight, and his face
grew pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you promise?&rdquo; repeated Elsie, sternly, and her
blazing eyes never left the changing face of the man
standing before her. Henderson faltered. He saw she
was in earnest, and he changed his manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be foolish, Elsie,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not folly,&rdquo; she answered in a determined voice.
&ldquo;Long have I borne with you; borne with your neglect,
your insults; but now I have made up my mind.
Either you marry me, or we both shall die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think for a moment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will think no more; I have nearly gone mad with
thinking; now I shall act. Tom Henderson, will you
marry me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you put it in that way I suppose I
must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Elsie&rsquo;s raised hand, with which she had been pointing
the revolver at Henderson&rsquo;s throat, fell at these words,
and a sigh of relief escaped her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it be so then,&rdquo; she said, in a strange, weary tone.
The strain had been so great; the struggle was over.
Her arm dropped; her head fell on her breast. But in
a moment&mdash;in this moment of weakness&mdash;the coward
before her sprang upon her, grasping her arm, and
wrenched the revolver from her grasp.</p>

<p>He did it so quickly that Elsie had not time to resist,
nor to realize his action. He held the revolver in the
air; he gave a brutal laugh of triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;will you shoot me now? So you
were going to force me to marry you, were you, by your
silly threats? But I won&rsquo;t, there; do you hear, I
won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He almost shouted the last words, and they fell on
the ears of a woman stunned with misery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she gasped forth. &ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be bullied into doing anything I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t mean to do by your tragedy airs,&rdquo; continued
Henderson, his passions rising as he spoke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
made you a fair offer; most of women would consider
it a handsome offer, but you&rsquo;re a fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked in his face with a stony look of despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to go back from what you promised?&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never promised! Once for all, Elsie, make the
best of the situation; take my money, and go away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hissed out this word with bitter emphasis. She
stood there facing him pale to the very lips. Henderson
held the revolver high in his strong hand, and she
knew she could not reach it. He had robbed her of
her weapon, but he had not conquered her soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have lied then,&rdquo; she said, with concentrated
scorn, &ldquo;as you have done a thousand times. I might
have known! But for all that you shall not marry Miss
Churchill. I will go to her to-morrow, and tell her the
whole story; tell her what you are, and how you have
treated me, and I will tell my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will do this?&rdquo; cried Henderson, in sudden fury.
&ldquo;You never shall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do it,&rdquo; repeated Elsie, doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear you shall not live to do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; again said Elsie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll shoot you dead before you do it!&rdquo; cried
Henderson, fiercely, pointing the revolver at Elsie as
he spoke.</p>

<p>The woman did not flinch as the man had done.
Perhaps she felt that all her life was ended that was
worth living for. At all events she did not swerve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swear that you will not go near Miss Churchill; that
you will never tell your father anything of what has
been between us,&rdquo; continued Henderson, still pointing
the revolver at Elsie&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;or by the heavens above
us I&rsquo;ll shoot you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell my father to-night; I will see Miss
Churchill to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were almost the unhappy woman&rsquo;s last words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Henderson, maddened by anger, by the wine he had
drunk, and by her obstinacy, with a savage oath pulled
the trigger of the weapon he held, and the next
moment Elsie, with a cry, made a little spring forward,
and a moment later fell fatally wounded at his feet.</p>

<p>Then Henderson began to realize what he had done.
He laid the revolver on the grass; he knelt down at
Elsie&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elsie, you are not any worse, are you?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
only meant to frighten you, I only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he was speaking the moon, which had hitherto
been partly obscured and hidden by the drifting clouds,
suddenly shone out in its full radiancy. It shone on
the face of a woman struggling in her death throes; on
a ghastly wound which had torn open one side of her
shapely throat, and from which a stream of blood was
pouring fast.</p>

<p>Henderson, horror-stricken, drew out his handkerchief
and tried to stanch this, but with a dying effort Elsie
pushed his hand aside. She opened her eyes; she
struggled for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom Henderson,&rdquo; she gasped out, for each breath
was a gasp, &ldquo;God will bring you to account for this&mdash;I
curse you with my dying breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this she spoke no more. Henderson, appalled
by his own deed, felt powerless. He knelt there and
watched the last struggles of the woman he had shot.
He knelt there when it was all over, and when the
loving, passionate heart that he had broken had ceased
to beat. Did some dim memories rise before him as he
did so? Did he think of Elsie as the bright young girl
he once had loved? If so, he uttered no word. He
waited till the last quiver was still, the last moan
hushed, and then pale, trembling in every limb, he rose.</p>

<p>Elsie Wray was dead, and he had killed her! The
night breeze seemed to whisper this, as they rustled in
the ravine below; strange voices muttered it in his ears.
Good God! And she had cursed him as she died!</p>

<p>Henderson shuddered as he remembered this. Again
he glanced tremblingly at the dead woman&rsquo;s face. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
flickering shadows of the moonlight still played on it;
the half-open eyes were full of scorn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But something must be done, yes, something must be
done, Henderson told himself after a brief interval of
horror. He must try to hide this deed that he had
committed, this murder that his hand had wrought.
Murder! The horrid word seemed to ring in his ears;
it seemed written in flames before his eyes. Suddenly
it all grew dark; the moon had hidden her light, and in
the gloom Henderson stood alone with his dead.</p>

<p>Then it flashed across his brain that he had shot
Elsie with the weapon that she had brought. This
seemed to offer a hope of deliverance to his mind. She
would be supposed to have shot herself. Who was
there to tell? Henderson listened a few moments with
bated breath. There was not a rustle, but the trees
below stirred with the night wind; not a sound, and it
was now dark, very dark.</p>

<p>Summoning all his courage, he once more approached
the dead woman&rsquo;s body. He meant to throw it down
the ravine, where chance might hide it. With a sickening
feeling of loathing he stooped and raised it in his
arms. Bah? As he did so something still warm ran
over his hand. He dropped the body with a suppressed
cry; it was Elsie&rsquo;s blood, and when he remembered this,
it added new horror to his soul.</p>

<p>But it must be done. With a great effort he once more
bent down. He pulled it along this time&mdash;this lifeless
thing he feared to touch. He dragged it to the edge of
the ravine; he rolled it over the sharp descent. He
heard it fall, then stop. He thought it had found a
resting place. But suddenly the crash of a branch
giving way fell on his ears. Again came a ghastly fall,
then another, then a third, and then all was still.</p>

<p>Henderson stood listening, spellbound with fear and
horror. Great drops of moisture fell from his forehead,
his very hair seemed to bristle with affright. Then
after a time of unbroken silence, he slightly recovered
himself. He sought for, and found, the revolver he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
had laid on the grass. This he flung down the ravine
after the dead woman, and having done this he turned
and fled from the spot with the black curse of murder
on his soul.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>THE DEW ON THE GRASS.</small></h2>


<p>When people have been very happy one day, they
naturally wish to be happy another. John Temple and
May Churchill had been very happy collecting the ferns
in the Dene, and before they parted John expressed a
wish that this pleasure might be repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have had a charming afternoon, have we not,
Miss Churchill?&rdquo; he said, when May stopped at a short
distance from her home and suggested that here they
had better part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think we have,&rdquo; answered May, half-demurely,
half-coquettishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; smiled John. &ldquo;And an
idea has just struck me, how lovely that place, Fern
Dene, would be in the early morning, when the dew is
on the grass?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How romantic you are, Mr. Temple!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was, but the weight of my years has crushed it
all out of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not look very old. How old are you, really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thirty, but I feel forty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty,&rdquo; repeated May, with a little laugh. &ldquo;Just
ten years older than I am!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that decade, what I would give to forget it,&rdquo;
said John Temple, half-seriously. &ldquo;To go back to my
lost youth; to be like you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>May shrugged her pretty shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I shall get old, too,&rdquo; she smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And cease to be the Mayflower,&rdquo; said John, with a
genuine sigh. &ldquo;Ah, that is very sad.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Again May Churchill laughed. She stood there a
picture of youth and beauty; a girl in the prime of her
girlhood, and conscious perhaps that John Temple&rsquo;s
gray eyes were fixed admiringly on her lovely face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;that will really be very sad.
Age makes no matter to ordinary-looking people, you
know, but to a flower&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When shall I begin to wither?&rdquo; asked May, archly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do not speak of it! And yet,&rdquo; he continued
more seriously, still looking at May, &ldquo;there are some
faces that must always be beautiful; some eyes that can
never grow dim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I plainly perceive that age has still left you romantic,
Mr. Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You inspire me, I was going to remark, to say foolish
things. But on reflection I perceive the speech lacks
politeness. But how about the dew on the grass! Will
it lie till ten o&rsquo;clock? Do let us meet in Fern Dene
to-morrow morning, Miss Churchill, at ten o&rsquo;clock to
see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you be there so early?&rdquo; smiled May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rise with the lark, I would soar, I would do
anything, if you will go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be fun, certainly. Very well, if you will
be there by ten, I will, but I do not expect to find you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said John Temple, fervently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we shall see,&rdquo; answered May, with a gay little
laugh. &ldquo;And now good-by, Mr. Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They shook hands and each went their separate way,
thinking of the other. May Churchill was amused,
excited, and flattered. How much more agreeable was
this well-bred man, she was thinking, than country-bred
young Henderson. In truth the Mayflower had never
taken very kindly to this admirer of hers. But her
father often invited Henderson to Woodside Farm, and
his shrewd eyes were not blind to the young man&rsquo;s love
for his pretty daughter. The squire of Stourton
Grange was a good match for May, Mr. Churchill had
decided in his practical way, and certain ulterior views
of his own made him wish to see May married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>May, however, was very happy at her home, and her
father had never mentioned anything of Henderson&rsquo;s
attentions to her. Her young brothers sometimes rallied
her about the young squire, but May took it all
very good-naturedly. But if Henderson ever had had
any chance of winning her affections, the time was past
after she had met John Temple.</p>

<p>She went home smiling and happy after parting with
him, but as she was entering the pleasant garden at
Woodside, to her consternation she met Mrs. Layton
coming out of the gate. The vicar&rsquo;s wife did not
approve of the Mayflower, nor of her pet name, but this
did not prevent her asking small favors from her, when
it suited Mrs. Layton&rsquo;s convenience to do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, here you are, Miss Margaret,&rdquo; she said, holding
out a thin, meager hand; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad I&rsquo;ve met you,
as I&rsquo;ve had a long walk, and the servant said you were
out. I wanted to see your father, but I dare say you
will do as well. It is our school feast on Thursday,
though, as you do not attend now, of course you do
not know. But still I hope Mr. Churchill will supply
the milk and cream gratis, as he kindly did last year?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt that he will,&rdquo; answered May, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, then I may look on that as settled. Any
little thing helps, you know; fruit or eggs, or anything.
Indeed, speaking of eggs, could I have half a dozen
fresh-laid ones to take away with me now, as the vicar
is very fond of a fresh-laid egg?&rdquo;</p>

<p>May Churchill blushed. Mrs. Layton knew perfectly
well that May had nothing to do with the selling of
eggs, nor the management of the poultry-yard. But
she simply chose to ignore this; she liked &ldquo;to keep
people in their proper stations,&rdquo; she used to say, and as
she considered a farmer&rsquo;s daughter ought to know
about the selling of eggs, she was determined to let
May Churchill know this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I mean to purchase them,&rdquo; Mrs. Layton
added, as May hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will inquire if we have any to spare,&rdquo; replied May,
just a little haughtily; and as she spoke she turned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
went in the direction of the dairy, and a few minutes
later reappeared, carrying a small basketful of fresh
eggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have brought you a few eggs, Mrs. Layton,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and I trust you will accept them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no; please tell me how much they are?&rdquo;
replied Mrs. Layton, fumbling for her purse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not sell eggs,&rdquo; answered May, coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not sell eggs! Dear me, I thought all farmer&rsquo;s
daughters sold eggs. But as you are so kind, I will
accept them; and you&rsquo;ll not forget to tell your father
about the milk and cream? Well, good-afternoon, Miss
Margaret; I think I must steal one of your roses,
though, before I go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It must be admitted that May Churchill entered the
house after this interview feeling a little ruffled. She
had felt so happy before, and had enjoyed her afternoon
so much, and then to be snubbed in this fashion!</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a vulgar old woman,&rdquo; she consoled herself by
thinking, and tried to forget her annoyance in arranging
the table prettily for her father&rsquo;s tea.</p>

<p>This meal was of a very substantial order. The
farmer dined early, but between seven and eight partook
of a heavy meat tea. Cold lamb, a fowl, and a
home-cured ham, and various other good things awaited
him, to which he presently did ample justice. He was
a very sober man, and healthful, and he laughed heartily
about Mrs. Layton asking for the milk and cream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not troubled with modesty, the parson&rsquo;s wife,
is she?&rdquo; he said. But somehow May did not tell her
father what Mrs. Layton had said about the selling of
eggs.</p>

<p>May&rsquo;s two young brothers were spending some days
with a neighboring farmer&rsquo;s son, and the father and
daughter were thus alone. And after tea was over Mr.
Churchill, having lit his pipe, looked more than once
reflectively at his pretty girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something to say to you, May,&rdquo; he said, at
last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; answered May, looking up. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
not afraid of anything her father might have to say to
her. He was always kind and generous in the matter
of household expenses, and there had never been any
squabbles between them regarding weekly bills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of marrying again, May,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Churchill, somewhat abruptly. &ldquo;You see you&rsquo;re
sure to marry, and the boys are young, and will want
someone to look after them&mdash;and so shall I,&rdquo; added the
farmer, with an uneasy laugh.</p>

<p>May did not speak for a moment, for she was completely
astonished. Her lovely wild-rose color deepened,
her eyes fell, and her hands played nervously
with some embroidery she held in her dainty fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mrs. Bradshaw of Castle Hill,&rdquo; proceeded Mr.
Churchill; &ldquo;you see she&rsquo;s a handy woman, and has a nice
bit of money, and there&rsquo;s some very good grass land at
Castle Hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bradshaw!&rdquo; repeated May in dismay. She
knew the buxom widow her father spoke of, both personally
and by repute, and had never considered her a
person fit to associate with. Her own mother had been
a lady, the daughter of a clergyman, and May had certainly
hoped that if her father married again he would
not marry a woman like Mrs. Bradshaw, who had first
been the wife of a country shopkeeper, and then of Mr.
Bradshaw, a farmer at Castle Hill. Altogether it was
a great blow to May Churchill, and she did not attempt
to offer any congratulations to her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not have thought of it,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Churchill, glancing at his young daughter&rsquo;s changing
face, &ldquo;but that you are certain to marry soon, May.
There&rsquo;s young Henderson of Stourton; anyone can see
what he wants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care for Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; replied May, hastily,
and without another word she rose quickly and left
the room, leaving Mr. Churchill much disappointed by
the conversation that had passed between them.</p>

<p>Then May went to her own room, and sat down to
think, with a galling sense of annoyance in her heart.
First Mrs. Layton and now her father had made her feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
her social inferiority to the man of whom she had thought
so pleasantly during the earlier part of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd, my going to meet Mr. Temple,&rdquo; she
reflected, not a little bitterly. &ldquo;No doubt he regards
me as a milkmaid, a pretty milkmaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose a few moments later, and stood looking at her
own likeness in the mirror. No milkmaid type this, but
a lovely young Englishwoman, with refined, delicate
features, and the most charming expression in the
world. May unconsciously smiled as she looked at herself
in the glass. It was very trying certainly to have a
stepmother like Mrs. Bradshaw thrust upon her, and to
be reproached for not selling eggs by Mrs. Layton, but
these things did not make her less fair.</p>

<p>She therefore decided that she would go and meet
Mr. Temple the next morning. And she did. She said
nothing to her father at breakfast about this early expedition,
but started as early as half-past nine o&rsquo;clock for
Fern Dene, without telling anyone in the house where
she was going.</p>

<p>She walked quickly and her spirits rose as she passed
through the fields in the fresh morning air. Yes, the
dew was still on the grass, she thought, smilingly, as she
glanced at the herbage growing beneath the hedge-rows.
Then presently she came to the little bridge across the
brook that led to the Dene. How the water sparkled in
the sunshine! Everything looked so bright; the blue
sky, the wavering boughs of the green trees dappling
the grass.</p>

<p>May walked on with a sense of exhilaration and
pleasure pervading her whole being. She walked on
until where the Dene narrows, stopped for a moment
and glanced up at the steep-wooded declivity at its side.
What made her suddenly start and turn pale? A little
cry broke from her lips; a ghastly sight met her horror-stricken
eyes.</p>

<p>A woman&rsquo;s body, with head hanging downward and
dark hair unbound, was suspended from a branch of one
of the largest trees. May made a step nearer with
shrinking dread. She thought first the poor creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
had hanged herself, but a second glance told her this
was not so.</p>

<p>There was a red stain of curdled blood around the
drooped throat, from which the handkerchief had fallen,
and the face, with its sightless, half-open eyes, nearly
touched the ground. May went closer&mdash;then she saw
the wound in the throat&mdash;the broken branches above;
she recognized the face! It was the handsome girl
from the Wayside Inn, the landlord&rsquo;s daughter, and
with a cry of horror May turned and fled from the
spot.</p>

<p>She ran until she came in sight of the little bridge at
the entrance of the Dene. On this, as he was in the
very act of crossing it, John Temple saw her come hurrying
on, evidently in a state of the greatest excitement
and agitation. Instead of the pretty smiling girl he
expected to meet, here was a woman who came toward
him with outstretched hand and a white, shocked face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mr. Temple,&rdquo; she gasped out, as they met,
&ldquo;something so dreadful has happened!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Churchill,&rdquo; he answered, taking both
her hands, &ldquo;what has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A poor girl, a poor woman, is lying I think murdered
farther up the Dene&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murdered?&rdquo; repeated John Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so, I fear so,&rdquo; continued May, who was trembling
in every limb. &ldquo;She is hanging from a tree&mdash;she
may have fallen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure she is dead?&rdquo; asked John Temple,
gravely. &ldquo;This has given you a great shock, I fear; but
I had better go at once and see if I can do anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered May, with a shudder. &ldquo;Oh! her
face is so awful, awful, Mr. Temple! I think I know
who it is; a poor girl I knew by sight. What shall we
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must see at once if help can be given. Are you
afraid to show me where she is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said May, in a low tone, and again she shuddered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not go all the way, you know,&rdquo; said John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Temple, kindly and gently. &ldquo;Come, lean on me; you
are trembling so that you can scarcely stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew her hand through his arm and spoke soothingly
to her, and May felt thankful that he was there.
His presence seemed to give her courage, and presently
she was able to show him where the poor girl&rsquo;s body
was hanging from the tree. John Temple left her for a
few minutes and went on. Then he, too, saw the terrible
sight that had filled May&rsquo;s heart with horror. He
went up and touched one of the poor girl&rsquo;s hands; he
felt for the stilled pulse. But he knew too well it was
useless. The ghastly face told its own tale. The
woman was dead; had probably been murdered, and
the miserable affair must, of course, at once be investigated.</p>

<p>He returned, therefore, to May and asked her if she
were afraid to go home as quickly as possible and give
the alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not like leaving the poor woman&rsquo;s body quite
alone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if you are afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered May; &ldquo;I will run home. Father
will most likely be about the place, and he will come
at once. I will go now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hurried away, while John Temple kept his dreary
watch. Presently she reached the homestead, and met
her father almost at the gate. Almost breathless and
panting she told the dreadful news, and Mr. Churchill
listened, surprised and shocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are you sure it is Wray&rsquo;s daughter, my dear?&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am almost sure,&rdquo; answered May. &ldquo;Oh, father, it
is such a dreadful, dreadful sight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case I had better ride over and break it to
poor Wray. Why, she was a fine, handsome, merry
girl; how ever can such a thing have happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the father and daughter were speaking, and
Mr. Churchill was considering what it would be best to
do, to their surprise and pain James Wray, the landlord
of the Wayside Inn, was seen approaching in a small
dog-cart in great haste toward the house. He pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
up when he recognized the Churchills, and they saw
that his face was pale and agitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not seen or heard anything of my girl, have
ye?&rdquo; he asked, excitedly, addressing Mr. Churchill,
whose eyes fell uneasily as he spoke. &ldquo;She left home
last night, and has never come back. I&rsquo;m on my way
to the station, and if I hear nothing of her there I must
get the police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come into the house a few minutes, Mr. Wray,&rdquo;
answered Mr. Churchill, feelingly; &ldquo;perhaps I may
have some news for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>James Wray sprang from the dog-cart and grasped
the farmer&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not bad!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say bad news about my
girl! What is it, man? What do you know?&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>DRAWN CLOSER.</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;You had better come into the house,&rdquo; again urged
Mr. Churchill; &ldquo;my daughter here may have something
to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then James Wray looked eagerly at May, whose face
grew very pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear there has been an accident,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to Elsie? Not to my girl!&rdquo; cried James Wray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;saw someone lying in Fern Dene&mdash;as if she had
fallen,&rdquo; said May in a trembling voice; &ldquo;I am not sure&mdash;who
it was&mdash;not sure it was Miss Wray&mdash;I ran to tell
father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fallen!&rdquo; repeated Wray, aghast. &ldquo;Where could
she have fallen from? How could my girl be in Fern
Dene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I send one of the men to bring Doctor Graham,
he&rsquo;s the nearest,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Churchill. &ldquo;I will
go with you to Fern Dene if you like, Mr. Wray.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be my girl there!&rdquo; said Wray, in violent
excitement. &ldquo;She went out about half-past eight o&rsquo;clock,
the barmaid says&mdash;how could she be there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to ascertain at any rate, and I&rsquo;ll send for
Doctor Graham at once. This poor young woman in Fern
Dene, whoever it be, may require some assistance,&rdquo;
answered Mr. Churchill, quietly.</p>

<p>He therefore at once dispatched one of the farm servants
for the doctor, who only lived a quarter of a mile
distant, and he whispered a word in May&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you well enough to go with us, May?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;And tell some of the women to bring brandy and
blankets; the poor soul may not be dead, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May made no reply. She had looked at the landlord&rsquo;s
agitated face, and great pity for him was in her heart.
But she was not quite sure of the dead woman&rsquo;s identity.
She thought it was Elsie Wray, but the face was so
awfully changed she could not be certain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may not be your daughter, Mr. Wray,&rdquo; she said,
tremulously, &ldquo;who is lying injured&mdash;but we had better
see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can not be my daughter,&rdquo; affirmed Wray, &ldquo;but we
can see, we can see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will drive May to Fern Dene,&rdquo; said Mr. Churchill.
&ldquo;It will take less time, and then we can take with us
what is necessary, and will you drive the doctor, Mr.
Wray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why wait for the doctor? Let us go at once,&rdquo;
answered the landlord, with nervous, eager impatience.
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be my girl there, and I must find her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well; he can follow. My horse will be harnessed
in a minute, and then we can start,&rdquo; said Mr.
Churchill; and very shortly afterward they did start.
Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s horse was a young and powerful one,
and they quickly drew in sight of the wooded dell that
hid so drear a sight. Here Mr. Churchill assisted May
out of the high dog-cart, and then fastened his horse to
a tree, and took out the brandy and blankets they had
brought. By this time Wray, who had been urging his
pony to its utmost speed, overtook them, and the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
together&mdash;May, her father, and the landlord&mdash;crossed
the little bridge and found themselves in the shady
Dene.</p>

<p>May went on, naturally with shrinking dread, and the
landlord with trembling footsteps. They had not gone
far when they met John Temple; he had heard their
voices in the silence around, and now advanced to meet
them, and as he did so his face was very grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a sad affair, Mr. Churchill,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope nothing very bad, Mr. Temple?&rdquo; answered
the farmer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks very black, at least,&rdquo; continued Temple;
&ldquo;there is a revolver lying near the body among the
undergrowth, but I thought it best not to touch it until
the police arrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The body!&rdquo; gasped the landlord, with staring eyes
fixed on John Temple&rsquo;s face, who did not know he was
the father of the unhappy Elsie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the poor woman is quite dead, has been dead
apparently for hours,&rdquo; answered Temple, and as he spoke
a sort of cry escaped the landlord&rsquo;s lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he asked in a hoarse voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not my girl, but still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is suspended from a tree a little farther up the
Dene,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I can show you the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no, Mr. Wray!&rdquo; now cried May, laying her
hand on the landlord&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Let father and me go
first&mdash;it&rsquo;s no sight for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the landlord pushed aside her detaining hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; he said, hoarsely, and he ran forward,
followed by the rest. Then when he beheld the ghastly
sight, the streaming black hair, the half-open eyes, a
great cry escaped his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My girl, my girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His words rang through the woods. He flung himself
on his knees; he raised the head; he looked wildly
in the face. Yes, it was his girl&mdash;his Elsie&mdash;lying
foully murdered in this lone spot!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elsie, who has done this?&rdquo; he asked in passionate
grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, help me to disentangle her; to lift her
down,&rdquo; now said May, with streaming eyes. &ldquo;Oh!
help us, Mr. Temple!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered John Temple, &ldquo;I will climb the
tree and disentangle her dress. You help to hold her
head and body, Mr. Churchill, while I go up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was slight and active, and soon the poor still form
was loose from the branch which had caught and held
it in its fall. They laid her gently on the grass. May
Churchill knelt down and covered the ghastly face and
the blue-edged wound on the shapely throat, and she
tried also to draw away the landlord from his dead
daughter&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come away, come away, Mr. Wray,&rdquo; she said,
pitifully; &ldquo;this is no place for you&mdash;I will stay with
her&mdash;you go with father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the unhappy man took no heed of her words.
He knelt there holding one of Elsie&rsquo;s cold hands; his
eyes were staring from his head with sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who killed thee, my lass?&rdquo; he asked again and
again; &ldquo;thee who had wronged none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may have been an accident,&rdquo; suggested May,
tearfully and soothingly.</p>

<p>But at this moment the doctor and some others
arrived on the spot, and the doctor at once knelt down
and removed the handkerchief from the face and throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This looks like murder,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone,
carefully examining the wound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a revolver lying there among the undergrowth,&rdquo;
pointed out John Temple.</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill went forward at these words to the
spot John indicated, and picked up the revolver and
looked at it attentively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Wray,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is your revolver&mdash;here
is your name engraved on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then James Wray raised his stony, grief-stricken
face, and looked at the revolver in the farmer&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s mine&mdash;how did it come here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks as if she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She never brought it&mdash;she has been lured here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
shot. Oh! my girl, my girl, that I should have lived
to see this day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed his heartrending grief. Elsie
had been his only child, and for her he had worked and
saved. He was well off, and for long had nourished a
secret hope that his daughter would marry the young
squire of Stourton Grange. And now it was all over;
she lay dead before him&mdash;had died a tragic death&mdash;and
a dark suspicion crossed his mind as he looked at
her motionless form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever&rsquo;s done it, I&rsquo;ll hunt him down!&rdquo; he swore,
inwardly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; his life for thine!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is useless to write of the painful details that followed.
The police arrived and Elsie Wray&rsquo;s body was
carried away, followed by her heart-broken father;
May Churchill also walked close to the bearers of the
dead, as they bore her down the Dene. But before this
was done, with gentle, womanly hands May had again
covered the face, and rolled up the long hair, and
arranged the dress in seemly fashion. And John
Temple stood by and watched her do this, with strange
emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not a mere pretty girl, then,&rdquo; he was thinking,
and he turned away with a restless sigh.</p>

<p>Then, when the sad procession had crossed the little
bridge at the commencement of the Dene, May and her
father returned to Woodside, and Elsie&rsquo;s body was carried
on to the Wayside Inn, for the inquest which was
necessary to be held on it. May was very much overcome
as she stood and watched them bear away the
poor girl whose tragic end she had been the first to discover.
She wished even to follow the dead the whole
way, but Mr. Churchill would not hear of this, and
John Temple also advised her not to do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let your father drive you home,&rdquo; he whispered;
&ldquo;you look quite done up as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So May was handed into her father&rsquo;s dog-cart, but
just as they were starting Mr. Churchill asked John
Temple to go with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I give you a lift, Mr. Temple?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, very much,&rdquo; answered John, with alacrity,
stepping up into the back seat of the dog-cart, and
when they reached the nearest road to Woodlea Hall,
he made no offer to descend, but accompanied Mr.
Churchill and May the whole way to Woodside Farm.</p>

<p>When they arrived there Mr. Churchill insisted that
he should remain to lunch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our early dinner, you know, Mr. Temple, but we
can offer you a fair slice of mutton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple accepted this invitation also, and then
judiciously began talking to the farmer of his horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle has given me a good allowance,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and I want a good horse. Have you anything you
think would suit me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill, who was a man with a keen eye to a
bargain, immediately led John away to inspect his
stables and paddocks. And it ended by John buying a
valuable riding-horse and the farmer feeling that he
had done an excellent morning&rsquo;s work. Then came
the early dinner, at which May presided, looking in
John&rsquo;s eyes more lovely still from the light pallor of
her smooth cheeks, and the faint violet rim round her
beautiful eyes. The tragic affair of the morning was
scarcely mentioned, but the meal was hardly over when
a summons was served at the farm for May and her
father both to attend the inquest on poor Elsie Wray&rsquo;s
body, which had to be held on the following morning.</p>

<p>Then some one came to see Mr. Churchill on business,
and John Temple and May were left alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go into the garden for a little while,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>So the two went out together and walked side by
side on the trim gravel walks, between the blooming
flower-beds, which were May&rsquo;s especial care. May made
some allusion to Elsie Wray&rsquo;s death, but after a word or
two on the subject John Temple changed the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She probably committed suicide, poor girl,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;her appearance indicated that she was a woman
of strong and passionate emotions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In any case it is so terribly sad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but do not think of it; we all must do so
to-morrow; let us put off the evil day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he began talking to her of a little tour he had
had in Normandy at this very time last year, telling
her of the quaint old French towns that he had
sojourned in, with their wide ramparts, spreading
orchards, and rosy pippins. He spoke well and graphically,
and somehow both forgot the time. Suddenly,
however, John glanced at his watch and gave an
exclamation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the day has flown!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Do you
know it is actually five o&rsquo;clock, and I left Woodlea at
half-past eight. My good uncle will naturally think
I have run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must tell them&mdash;&rdquo; began May, and then she
paused embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell them I went out for an early walk, and
by accident met you, who had just made the sad discovery
which you did. There is no need to say anything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; answered May, relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will add that I went back with you to Fern
Dene, and saw the poor girl and remained there while
you ran home for assistance to your father. This
affair is sure to be greatly talked of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is most painful to be mixed up in it, and I
feel so dreadfully sorry for her poor father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole thing is painful&mdash;but I must go. Good-by,
Miss Churchill&mdash;I wonder if you would give me a
rose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered May; and she stooped down and
plucked a crimson bud. &ldquo;Will you have this one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks&mdash;once more good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then their hands met, and for a moment May looked
up in John Temple&rsquo;s face, and she blushed softly as she
did so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>THE WAGES OF SIN.</small></h2>


<p>It was a dark night when Henderson slunk home
after his accursed deed; dark and late, yet his mother
was waiting up for him and anxiously listening for his
return. She heard him turn the latch-key in the door,
and went out into the hall to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are late, Tom,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He started violently when he saw her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You up!&rdquo; he said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I waited to say good-night. Why, Tom,&rdquo; she
added the next minute, lifting her lighted candle
higher, &ldquo;whatever is the matter with your coat?
Where did you get that stain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shudder ran through his strong stalwart frame as
she asked the question, and his guilty eyes fell on the
red stain on his coat sleeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stumbled and fell; it is nothing,&rdquo; he said, yet
more hoarsely; &ldquo;good-night, mother,&rdquo; and without
another word he turned and hurried up the unlighted
staircase, leaving his mother looking after him in absolute
astonishment.</p>

<p>He always smoked before he went to bed, and usually
he drank some whisky, and therefore she could not
account for his conduct. She grew anxious about him,
and after she had retired to her own bedroom she
thought she would go quietly to his room-door and see
after him. As she approached it she thought she felt
a faint smell of burning. She was afraid to go into his
room, for he was spoilt and wayward and did not care
to be interfered with, so she knelt quietly down and
peered through the key-hole.</p>

<p>A strange sight met her startled gaze. Her son was
standing by the fireplace, without his shirt on, and he
was burning it by degrees in the grate! She saw him
cut out one sleeve and then the other and burn them,
adding matches to the flaming linen to make it consume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
more quickly. The coat that he had worn during the
evening&mdash;a light cloth summer one&mdash;was lying on a
chair near. Presently he took this up, and shuddered as
he did so. Then he cut off the lower part of one sleeve&mdash;and
consigned this also to the flames. He watched
it burn, and then rolled up the coat, and put it into
the drawer of his wardrobe and locked the drawer.
After this, he put on a dressing-gown and approached
the door of the room from which his mother had
scarcely time to fly, when he opened it and came out
on the landing with a lighted candle in his hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson had hurried unseen into an empty
room next door, and she now watched her son descend
the staircase, and could see that he was ghastly pale,
his whole appearance denoting great agitation. A
great terror crept over the poor woman&rsquo;s heart, and a
nameless dread took possession of her mind. She dare
not follow him, but stood hidden in the shadow, and in
a few minutes she heard him returning up the stairs.
This time he was carrying a bottle of whisky and a
glass, and Mrs. Henderson saw his hands were trembling
as he did so.</p>

<p>He entered his bedroom and at once began drinking
the whisky. He drank glass after glass, though he
was by no means in the habit of doing so, and at last
flung himself, half-undressed, stupefied, on the bed, and
speedily fell into a heavy slumber.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Henderson herself could not sleep for thinking
of him. Something had happened, at all events,
greatly to disturb him, and Mrs. Henderson felt ill at
ease.</p>

<p>The next morning he did not come down to breakfast
at the usual time, and finally his mother went up to his
room-door and rapped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s late, Tom; are you not well?&rdquo; she called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a beastly headache. I&rsquo;ll be down directly,&rdquo; he
answered, and when he did appear Mrs. Henderson
was quite shocked at his appearance. He looked ill,
haggard, and nervous, and ate nothing, drinking his tea,
in sullen silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>All the rest of the morning it was the same thing.
He did not go out, but seemed in a state of restless
excitement that he could not suppress. Then about
twelve o&rsquo;clock a rumor reached Stourton Grange that a
murder had been committed in Fern Dene. The
gardener heard it outside and hurried into the kitchen
to tell his news. It was not known at first who it was.
A woman&rsquo;s body had been found in the Dene, that was
all, and when Mrs. Henderson went into her larder to
inspect its contents and order the dinner, her cook
followed her and told her mistress what she had heard.</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson turned actually faint as she listened.
Tom&rsquo;s strange conduct instantly recurred to her mind.
But no, what folly, she told herself the next minute.
But, nevertheless, she went into the breakfast-room
where Tom was sitting pretending to read the newspapers,
with trembling footsteps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they say something dreadful has
happened in Fern Dene&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was looking at her son&rsquo;s face as she spoke, and
the ghastly pallor that at once spread over it filled her
own heart with terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; he asked, hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;say a murder,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Henderson
in a faltering voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A murder! What folly!&rdquo; repeated Tom, and he
rose hastily and flung the newspaper on the floor as he
did so. His whole manner indicated extreme agitation,
and his mother grew pale as she watched him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cock-and-bull story have you got hold of
now, I wonder?&rdquo; he went on harshly, a few moments
later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say a woman&rsquo;s body has been found in the
Dene,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Henderson, slowly, and Tom
Henderson visibly started as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; he said, abruptly, and a moment
later he hastily left the room, leaving his mother greatly
agitated.</p>

<p>Henderson had not left the house the whole morning,
but after pacing up and down his own bedroom for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
some minutes an extreme restlessness came over him,
and he went toward the stables, and in the stable yard
he found Jack Reid, the groom, rubbing down a horse.</p>

<p>The man did not look around as his master
approached him, but went on with his task, while Henderson
stood a moment or two looking on without
speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Billy looks very fresh this morning,&rdquo; he said, presently,
with affected carelessness, and the groom, still
without looking around, only nodded his head in answer
to his master&rsquo;s remark.</p>

<p>Henderson moved uneasily, and then, after another
pause and in an uneven voice, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this story, Jack, my mother&rsquo;s been telling
me about some woman or other being found in Fern
Dene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Jack did look around, and Henderson&rsquo;s eyes
shifted and fell as he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Miss Wray,&rdquo; he said, in a sullen tone; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
been found dead in the Dene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Wray! Dead!&mdash;impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true enough, though,&rdquo; answered Jack, roughly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know? Who found her?&rdquo; queried
Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Churchill, from Woodside Farm, they say, and
she ran and met the young squire from the Hall. Anyhow,
she&rsquo;s dead&mdash;she&rsquo;s been shot, and they say an
inquest will be held on her to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson turned absolutely livid as he listened to
Jack&rsquo;s information. He took two or three hasty strides
down the stable yard, and then he once more returned
to the groom&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; he began, and then hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Jack, not over-respectfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; went on Henderson, forcing himself
to speak, &ldquo;taking a note to her from me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack laconically nodded his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That note,&rdquo; went on Henderson, desperately, &ldquo;was
to ask her to meet me in Fern Dene, but I changed my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
mind and did not go. She had got some folly into her
head about marrying me, and so I thought afterward it
was better not to go. But she may have gone&mdash;do you
see, Jack? Yes, to be sure she may have gone,&rdquo; continued
Henderson, wiping his dark brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, Jack, about that note? Did anyone see you
give it to her?&rdquo; he went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there were some fellows sitting at the bar saw
me,&rdquo; answered Jack, coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity&mdash;but it can&rsquo;t be helped,&rdquo; said Henderson,
in increasing agitation. &ldquo;But&mdash;did anyone
hear the answer she sent me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she walked straight back into the bar with
your letter in her hand after she had read it, and her
eyes were just blazing in her head. &lsquo;Tell him I will be
there,&rsquo; she said, and the fellows heard it as well as me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Henderson wiped his brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may have gone&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say anything about
it, you know. I never went near, but that note may
get me into some trouble. Jack, I&rsquo;ll make it worth your
while to hold your tongue&mdash;to say nothing about the
note, as only you knew it was from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; answered Jack, doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course you knew, but you must not mention
this to anyone. I&rsquo;ll give you as much as five pounds&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten would suit me better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll make it ten, then. If anyone asks
who gave you the note, say a stranger you met on the
road gave you a shilling to deliver it to Miss Wray. Do
you understand? Put it on a stranger, and you shall
have ten pounds, for I do not wish to be mixed up in
this matter at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can well understand that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Jack, she may have gone to meet me, and
when she found I was not there she may have shot herself.
She is shot, you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dead as a herring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shocking affair; really a shocking affair,&rdquo; continued
Henderson, hastily; &ldquo;poor girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, poor lass!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It might have happened so&mdash;in her disappointment,
you know, she may have shot herself, that is if she had
anything to shoot herself with?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say her father&rsquo;s revolver was lying nigh her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I fear it has happened so. Don&rsquo;t you think so,
Jack? How lucky for me that I did not go near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite a close shave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite a close shave indeed. Well, Jack, now
we&rsquo;ve arranged it, I&rsquo;ll go into the house and get
you the ten pounds&mdash;but remember you were to say
a stranger&mdash;that a stranger gave you the note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack nodded and Henderson hastily returned to the
house, and speedily reappeared with two crisp five-pound
bank notes in his pocket, which he soon placed
in Jack&rsquo;s horny hand, who at once deposited them in
his corduroys. But when they were safely there, he
looked up with his shrewd brown eyes in his master&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About that note,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe the poor lass
left it behind her, and it was in yer writing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson&rsquo;s face fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil it was!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And maybe she&rsquo;s other letters, put by that ye wrote?
I&rsquo;ve taken other letters, perhaps, signed by yer name.
No, master, the story about the stranger giving it to me
won&rsquo;t wash. It would only make me out a big liar, and
not help ye. You&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; to face the letters, and stick to
the story that you did not go to meet the poor lass when
she met her death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I did not go. After I wrote the letter, I
got afraid to meet her,&rdquo; said Henderson, in great
agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stick to that; ye got afraid to go, and the poor lass
must ha&rsquo; shot herself because ye broke yer word; ye
may make them believe that, not the other, for lots o&rsquo;
folks knew what was between ye and poor Elsie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson&rsquo;s teeth almost chattered in his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo; he said, tremblingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure; Alice the barmaid knew and others.
Stick to the story that ye did not go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack&rsquo;s manner as he said this was very determined,
and Henderson begun to see the prudence of his advice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; he said, after thinking a
moment or two. &ldquo;The letter I sent yesterday was not
signed in full&mdash;only my initials&mdash;but I have sent letters
signed in full, and she may have kept them. It&rsquo;s a
confounded business altogether, and I wish I had never
seen her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late to wish that,&rdquo; replied Jack, significantly;
and then he resumed grooming the horse, while with a
moody brow and an uneasy heart Henderson returned
to the house, feeling that he would be almost sure to be
called to account for the letter he had written the day
before to poor Elsie Wray.</p>

<p>And he was. The afternoon had not passed when a
police-constable arrived at Stourton Grange and asked
to see Mr. Henderson. With a sinking heart he went to
this interview, and the policeman informed him that he
was the bearer of a summons for him to be present at
the inquiry to be held on the death of Elsie Wray during
the following morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve one for your groom, Jack Reid, Mr. Henderson,&rdquo;
continued the policeman, with his eyes fixed
searchingly on Henderson&rsquo;s changing face; &ldquo;he delivered
a letter it seems to Miss Wray on the day of her
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; faltered Henderson; &ldquo;but I did not go near.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must reserve your evidence until you are before
the coroner, and you had better give it carefully,&rdquo; and
with these warning words the policeman took his departure,
leaving Henderson a prey to the most morbid
dread.</p>

<p>And scarcely had the constable gone when Mrs. Henderson
crept into the room with an almost colorless
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she said, in trembling accents, &ldquo;what has that
man been here for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve to attend the inquest on that girl found in Fern
Dene to-morrow morning,&rdquo; answered Henderson, huskily,
turning away his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They say it&rsquo;s the girl from the Wayside Inn. Oh,
Tom, did you go and meet her?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Henderson,
piteously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never went near her; but, mother, a confounded
thing has happened. I was ass enough to write to her to
ask her to meet me; I wanted to buy her off, in fact. When
I was almost a boy I got entangled with her, and she
was always urging some claims or other that she thought
she had against me, and I wanted to pay her a big sum
and be done with it. Well, I asked her to meet me last
night, but I did not go. I went out for a short time, as
you remember, and then I turned back and came home.
If you are questioned you must say I was home early,
or never out. Do you understand? They will want to
throw suspicion on me on account of the confounded
letter I wrote. The girl must have gone, I suppose, and
shot herself because I did not go, for her father&rsquo;s revolver
was lying beside her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Henderson had turned absolutely white during
this garbled narrative. From this hour she never
doubted her son&rsquo;s guilt. She looked at him with terror-stricken
eyes, but no word came from her trembling
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must say I was home early; only out a few
minutes,&rdquo; repeated Henderson, doggedly, and almost
with a gasp Mrs. Henderson whispered out a few words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were&mdash;at home early,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it; you mayn&rsquo;t be asked, but that&rsquo;s your
answer, and now I&rsquo;ll go out for a walk, for I&rsquo;ve a disgusting
headache still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned and went out of the room as he spoke, and
Mrs. Henderson leaned against the table for support.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! my unhappy boy,&rdquo; she murmured with her white
lips; &ldquo;my miserable boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few minutes she saw him go down the avenue
smoking, and then with feeble, trembling footsteps, as
though suddenly aged, she proceeded to her son&rsquo;s bedroom.
She locked the door, and then drew out her
housewifely bunch of keys. With these, one after the
other, she tried to unlock the drawer in Henderson&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
wardrobe, where she had seen him hide the coat he had
worn the night before, and from which he had cut the
stained sleeve. At last one of her keys opened the
drawer, and with shaking fingers Mrs. Henderson drew
out the coat she had seen him roll up and place there.
With a sickening dread she now unrolled it. Half of
one of the sleeves was gone as she knew, but a faint
stain&mdash;a smudge, as it were, on the breast&mdash;quickly
attracted her attention.</p>

<p>She shuddered as she looked at it; shuddered and
turned faint, but with an heroic effort she conquered
this failing of her bodily powers. She relocked the
drawer, and wrapped her son&rsquo;s mutilated coat in some
brown paper she found lying on the table. She carried
this parcel to her own room, after carefully brushing
out the grate in Henderson&rsquo;s; and wrapping the burnt
fragments it contained in paper, she carried these away
also.</p>

<p>When she reached her bedroom she concealed these
two parcels, and then rang for her housemaid. She
bade this maid make up and light the fire, for, as it was
summer time, there were no coals in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel so chilly, Jane,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I must have got
cold, and will be all the better for a fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fire was soon lit, and when it had burnt up and
the servant was gone, Mrs. Henderson at once commenced
to cut her son&rsquo;s coat to pieces, and burnt it
gradually. She was afraid to make a smell of burning
by doing it altogether. But every shred of it was at last
consumed, and Mrs. Henderson watched it disappear
with a miserable heart.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Henderson had once more strolled
toward the stables, and there, as he expected to find,
was Jack Reid. The groom looked up and nodded
when he saw his master approaching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted a word wi&rsquo; ye, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
hanging about, and all the country-side&rsquo;s up about the
murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about it,&rdquo; said Henderson, doggedly,
&ldquo;but&mdash;you were right, Jack, about the letter; the policeman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
who served the summons about the inquest said
something about you having taken one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew I was right; folks saw me gi&rsquo; it to her, and
there&rsquo;s a great talk over it. And the police ha&rsquo; been
examining where she was found all the day, and they
say she must ha&rsquo; shot herself, or been shot, on the high
ridge above the Dene. There&rsquo;s blood there, and she
must either ha&rsquo; fallen into the Dene or been thrown, as
the branches are broke all the way down from the top
to where she was found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson&rsquo;s face grew literally ghastly as he listened
to these words, and his groom watched him with a certain
grim humor in his expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never went near,&rdquo; said Henderson, huskily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, stick to that; ye never went near; ye only
asked her to go; and one good job is that the old man&rsquo;s
pistol was found beside her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have shot herself. My mother will tell
them I was in the house all night; I never was out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The groom made no answer to this, and after a few
moments&rsquo; silence Henderson turned sullenly away.
There was something in the groom&rsquo;s manner that
frightened him; a suppressed insolence and unbelief in
the man&rsquo;s tone.</p>

<p>And later in the day, as he sat moodily smoking after
dinner, he received a message by one of the maids that
Jack Reid wished to speak to him. He rose and went
to the hall door, where he found the groom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ha&rsquo; a word wi&rsquo; ye, sir, about one of the horses?&rdquo;
he said, with a significant look, and Henderson followed
him out as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about the horses, sir,&rdquo; he continued, as
soon as they were a little distance from the house,
&ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t want any o&rsquo; the women folk to hear what
I have got to say. But the missus mustn&rsquo;t say ye were
never out last night. Ben Wood, the carter, saw ye out
about half-past eight, and is ready to swear it. But
I&rsquo;ve sent for ye to say that ye&rsquo;d best say ye were down
at the stables then, and I&rsquo;ll back ye out. Say ye were
on yer way to the stables when Ben met ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Jack, you must swear this, or there&rsquo;ll be
no end of trouble,&rdquo; answered Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, trouble enough, anyhow; for, master, I&rsquo;ve
another word for ye&mdash;ye&rsquo;re watched. The police ha&rsquo;
their eye on ye, and ye&rsquo;ll not go in or out of the house
now unless they know.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>A SILENT WITNESS.</small></h2>


<p>Tom Henderson returned to the house after this last
interview with his groom in a truly pitiable state of
terror and alarm. And a man, a stranger, passed him
in the avenue. This was no doubt one of his watchers;
his footsteps were dogged; he was a free agent no
more.</p>

<p>He turned cold and shuddered when he thought of it.
Dread visions rose before him, and the terrible penalty
of his crime grimly haunted his mind.</p>

<p>As he entered the house he suddenly remembered
the coat he had worn the day before, when he had gone
to meet the hapless Elsie. He had cut out and burnt
the stained sleeve, but what if the house was searched
and the coat discovered in its&mdash;as he supposed&mdash;present
condition? No, it must be destroyed entirely, he told
himself.</p>

<p>But how to do this? If he burnt it the smell of the
burning cloth would spread through the house. He
would bury it in the garden somewhere, he finally
decided; but he must wait to do this; must be sure that
no one was loitering about, spying his actions.</p>

<p>He waited until midnight. Mrs. Henderson had not
come down-stairs to dinner, nor during the whole evening.
She had sent a message to her son that she had a
cold, and was unable to appear. Henderson, therefore,
had only his own miserable company. And to sustain
his courage he kept drinking glass after glass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
whisky, and by twelve o&rsquo;clock had certainly had more
than enough.</p>

<p>When the clock pointed to this hour he rose, and
quietly as possible stole upstairs for the purpose of
bringing down the coat that he intended to conceal.
He unlocked the drawer in the wardrobe where he
knew he had placed it, and started back with sudden
astonishment and dismay, to find it was gone! He
absolutely shook with fear. Where and how had it disappeared?
He turned everything over in the drawer
twenty times with trembling hands, but did so, as he
knew, in vain.</p>

<p>He never thought of his mother about the matter for
a moment. Either it had been taken as evidence against
him, or&mdash;and his guilty soul shivered within him at the
idea&mdash;some supernatural agency had been at work,
and the restless spirit of the dead Elsie had carried
away the blood-stained garment.</p>

<p>This thought filled him with absolute horror. He
glanced furtively at the dark corners of the room; he
fancied that unseen things were near, and at last, unable
to endure the strain any longer, he once more hurried
down-stairs, and spent the night as best he could on the
dining-room couch, after first stupefying himself with
whisky.</p>

<p>In the morning he felt in a wretched state alike of
mind and body. The inquest on the unfortunate Elsie
Wray was to be held at eleven o&rsquo;clock at the Wayside
Inn, and thither Henderson knew he must go. He had
to face this ordeal, however ill he was prepared for it,
and Jack Reid, the groom, drove him over in the dog-cart
at the appointed hour. Henderson was conscious
that the people who met him in the country lanes
glanced at him with suspicious and lowering looks. His
connection with the unhappy Elsie had been whispered
about, and many were ready to take the blackest view
of the case.</p>

<p>Jack Reid did not fail to impress on his young master
during this drive that he must give his evidence with
the greatest caution; telling him again and again that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
it was useless to deny sending the letters that lured
Elsie to her untimely end. They agreed between them,
in fact, what each had to say, and with this understanding
they at length arrived at the Wayside Inn.</p>

<p>May Churchill and her father were there before them,
and after the jury had viewed the body, May was the
first witness called. She gave her evidence clearly
and simply, and her remarkable beauty as she did so
excited great admiration. When he first heard her sweet
low-toned voice a thrill passed through Henderson&rsquo;s
whole frame, and for some moments he could not find
courage to look in her face, as she spoke of her ghastly
discovery in Fern Dene. Not so John Temple! He
could not take his eyes away from this fair girlish witness,
and once May looked at him when she described
meeting him after she found poor Elsie.</p>

<p>John Temple corroborated her words, and then her
father. After this James Wray, the landlord, gave his
evidence with deep emotion, and then Alice, the barmaid.
She had waited up for her young mistress, who
had never returned, and she had waited for Elsie on
previous occasions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know who she went to meet?&rdquo; one of the
jurymen asked.</p>

<p>The barmaid hesitated, and then glanced at Henderson&rsquo;s
changing face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understood it was Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she ever tell you so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the girl, and then she detailed how the
groom from Stourton Grange had brought a letter for
Miss Wray in the afternoon, and how her mistress had
seemed greatly upset at receiving it, and how she had
gone into the bar and said to Reid, the groom, &ldquo;Tell
him I will be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reid then gave his evidence, saying that his master
had given him this letter to take to Miss Wray and that
he had delivered it into her own hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever taken other letters to Miss Wray?&rdquo;
he was asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, once or twice,&rdquo; replied the groom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;From your master, Mr. Henderson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Miss Wray seem upset when she gave you the
message for your master?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seemed a bit flurried like, I thought,&rdquo; answered
Jack.</p>

<p>After this Henderson himself was called, and every
eye in the room was fixed on his tall, stalwart form and
handsome face as he went forward. He was cautioned
in the usual manner, but with a great mental effort he
said calmly enough:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not wish to conceal anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wrote the letter that your groom delivered to
Miss Wray, and which was found in her room after her
death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The letter was then handed to the jury, and after they
had read it Henderson&rsquo;s examination was continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You asked her to go and meet you on the ridge
above Fern Dene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, but afterward I made up my mind not to go.
I got frightened,&rdquo; answered Henderson, in a low tone,
and with downcast eyes. &ldquo;There had been some talk
of a marriage between us, as you may see by what I
wrote to her, and I wished to be done with it, that was
why I wrote. But I thought afterward I would write
again the next day instead of going&mdash;I was afraid to
meet her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you out during the evening of Miss Wray&rsquo;s
death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, for a short time; I went down to the stables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you never went near Fern Dene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never; I was in early; my mother and Jack Reid
were the only persons I spoke to during the whole
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack Reid was recalled, and confirmed this statement.</p>

<p>His master came down to the stables about half-past
eight, he said, &ldquo;and stayed a good bit;&rdquo; and then he
saw him walk toward the house.</p>

<p>Then came the medical evidence. The wound in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
throat might have been self-inflicted, or it might not, the
doctor deposed. That the fatal shot had been fired quite
close to the dead woman there was abundant evidence to
prove, but whether inflicted by her own hand it was
impossible positively to say. She had been shot on the
ridge above Fern Dene, and had either staggered back
and fallen over the declivity to the Dene below, or been
thrown down. The evidence altogether was of so unsatisfactory
a nature, that the inquest was adjourned to
enable the police to endeavor to obtain some more positive
information. James Wray swore that the revolver
found near his daughter&rsquo;s body was his property, and
this was a fact that naturally pointed to suicide. No
one else could have obtained this weapon, as Wray
deposed he had seen it in its usual place on the morning
of Elsie&rsquo;s death. In her despair at her false lover not
keeping his appointment she had probably shot herself,
many were inclined to believe, while others did not give
credence to Henderson&rsquo;s statement that he had not been
to Fern Dene on the night of her death. At all events
neither the coroner nor the jury were satisfied, and the
adjourned inquest was appointed to take place in a
week. Henderson heard this in sullen silence, and then,
after beckoning to Reid, he left the house, without
attempting to exchange a word with any of those present.
Once he looked at May Churchill as he passed her,
but the girl&rsquo;s eyes fell as they met his. She did not
believe that he had shot poor Elsie, but she believed
that he had broken her heart, and a strong feeling of
womanly indignation filled May&rsquo;s breast.</p>

<p>In silence still, Henderson mounted his dog-cart, and
in silence also his groom commenced to drive him homeward.
They had gone quite a quarter of a mile before
either of the men spoke. Then Henderson said uneasily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you think it went off, Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fairly well,&rdquo; replied Jack, laconically.</p>

<p>After this there was very little said between them
until they reached the Grange. But as Henderson was
descending from the dog-cart, Jack Reid suddenly
addressed him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;After ye&rsquo;ve had a drink, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will ye come
down to the stables?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; answered Henderson, testily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a
beastly headache, and I don&rsquo;t want to talk of this hateful
affair any more to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do,&rdquo; answered Jack Reid, doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nuisance&mdash;&rdquo; began Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must see ye, sir,&rdquo; interrupted the groom, determinedly,
and Henderson, after glancing at him, seeing
the expression of his face, nodded and went into the
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come down presently,&rdquo; he said, and this apparently
satisfied Reid, as he drove the horse at once on
toward the stables.</p>

<p>Henderson then proceeded to the dining-room, where
he found his mother sitting pale and trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; she said, tremulously, and then she paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s adjourned,&rdquo; he answered briefly, and then he
went to the sideboard and poured out some spirit, which
he eagerly drank, and his mother had not courage to ask
him any further questions. She kept looking at him
fugitively, her heart filled with the direst apprehensions.
She saw him drink more spirit, and then he left the
room, going toward the stables with a lowering brow
and an angry heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound the fellow,&rdquo; he muttered, thinking of his
groom. He believed that Reid wished him to pay for
the evidence he had given at the inquest, and Henderson
considered the ten pounds that Reid had already
received ample reward.</p>

<p>When he reached the stables he found the groom
smoking in the yard. Reid went on with his pipe as
his master approached him, and this increased Henderson&rsquo;s
feeling of anger against him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, addressing the groom sharply,
&ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Reid took his pipe out of his mouth and looked
straight in Henderson&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was good evidence I gave for ye to-day,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I am quite ready to acknowledge that,&rdquo;
answered Henderson somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a word of mine might have hanged ye, may
hang ye yet,&rdquo; continued the groom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Henderson, turning
pale to the very lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Reid, emphatically, &ldquo;that yer hand, and
yer hand alone, spilt that poor lass&rsquo; blood. I&rsquo;ve held
my tongue, but I saw ye shoot her, and then fling her
down the bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; faltered Henderson, with his white lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no lie, but God&rsquo;s truth. I watched ye that night,
and followed ye to the ridge above Fern Dene, and
heard every word ye spoke, and what the lass said to
ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was not there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ye were there sure enough, master,&rdquo; answered
Reid with a scornful laugh. &ldquo;Poor Elsie carried her
father&rsquo;s pistol wi&rsquo; her to make yer promise to keep yer
word, and make her yer lawful wife. She threatened
ye, and ye did promise, and then snatched the pistol
frae the poor lass&rsquo;s hand. And when she said she wad
tell her father and Miss Churchill, yer shot her.
It&rsquo;s no good denying it, for I can prove each word I say,
and hang ye as easy as hold up my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson&rsquo;s tall form absolutely tottered, and he
leaned back against the yard pump for support.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;can prove nothing,&rdquo; he faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I? I saw the moon come out and shine on her
dead face, and I heard her curse ye before she died. I
saw her blood run over yer hand and stain yer shirt
and the coat ye wore. Where is that coat now, master;
ye have not worn it since?&rdquo; And again the groom
laughed.</p>

<p>Henderson shuddered; this man had stolen the coat
then, he thought, and was thus able to produce this
damning evidence against him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much&mdash;?&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much will I take to hold my tongue?&rdquo; continued
Reid, as Henderson hesitated and paused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, a man should pay a long price for his life anyhow?
I heard ye offer poor Elsie two thousand pounds
to settle yer debt to her, and I&rsquo;ll take not a penny less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson did not speak. Great drops of dew broke
out on his forehead; he felt powerless in his servant&rsquo;s
hands. He looked in the groom&rsquo;s sharp face, and the
man knew he could make his own terms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call it cheap,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dirt cheap; two thousand
pounds for yer life. Well, master, think it over, and
if yer wise ye&rsquo;ll not think long&mdash;I&rsquo;ve told ye my
price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson made no answer; he turned away and
went staggering to the house like a drunken man. He
knew now what his position would be, and that this
man was his master for his whole life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>DANGEROUS MOMENTS.</small></h2>


<p>When the first inquiry as to the cause of Elsie
Wray&rsquo;s death was ended, and the adjournment
announced, something which he could not resist drew
John Temple to the side of the room where May
Churchill and her father were standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, addressing May, &ldquo;one part at least
of a very painful affair for you is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May looked gratefully up in his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has been most painful, but I am so very,
very sorry for Mr. Wray. I should like to go and
shake hands with him, but he has never looked at
me,&rdquo; answered May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, I think I should go,&rdquo; advised John; &ldquo;the feeling
that true sympathy is given to us is always grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landlord was standing with a stern face and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
kindling eyes as she approached him. He had just
watched the departure of Henderson and his groom,
and he believed now that Henderson had, to say the
least of it, been the cause of Elsie&rsquo;s death. He had
read the insulting letter the young man had sent her,
and with his own tongue he had acknowledged there
had been &ldquo;some talk of a marriage&rdquo; between them.
Deceived and betrayed, the poor girl might have put
an end to her own life. But not less did James Wray
consider him Elsie&rsquo;s murderer, and he was vowing
vengeance in his heart when May Churchill, with her
flower-like face, drew near him and placed her small
hand timidly in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wray,&rdquo; she said, and that was all. But the
landlord needed not words to tell him of the true feelings
of her heart. In that gentle touch, in those beautiful
eyes, he read her great sympathy and regret. He
felt sure she did not despise nor scorn his dead Elsie,
and that her womanly tenderness forgave all her shortcomings.
His hard eyes grew dim, and he placed a
horny brown hand in her white pretty one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear,&rdquo; he said, and turned away to
hide his emotion.</p>

<p>John Temple had watched this meeting, and fully
appreciated it. Mr. Churchill was busy talking to one
of the jurymen, a neighbor, and John once more speedily
found himself at May&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go outside,&rdquo; he said, and May went. They
stood talking together until Mr. Churchill joined them,
and Mr. Churchill spoke very cordially to John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to come over to Woodside again, Mr.
Temple, and try the mare before I send her to the
Hall stables,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When will it be convenient
for you to do so? This afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that will suit me very well,&rdquo; answered John;
and while a few moments later her father went to see
after his trap, John had a word to half-whisper into
May&rsquo;s willing ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see you again, then,&rdquo; he said, and May smiled
her answer, and as her father drove her back to Woodside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
John Temple&rsquo;s words and looks recurred again
and again to her mind.</p>

<p>As for John, he walked back to the Hall, thinking
only of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is the dearest little girl,&rdquo; he told himself, and
he wished the afternoon were already come. But he
found when he arrived at his uncle&rsquo;s house that he was
eagerly awaited for, and that he was expected to give a
complete account of all that had taken place during the
inquest.</p>

<p>The news of Elsie Wray&rsquo;s tragic death had indeed
created an immense sensation in the neighborhood.
Young Henderson of Stourton Grange was so well
known, and had frequently visited at Woodlea Hall,
and when John Temple entered the dining-room he
found both Mrs. Temple and her mother, Mrs. Layton,
eagerly talking of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here you are at last,&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple.
&ldquo;Now come and tell us all about it, and what had Tom
Henderson to do with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good deal, I fear,&rdquo; answered John, seating himself
at the luncheon table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Temple, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By his own account he wrote to the unfortunate
girl to ask her to meet him on the ridge above Fern
Dene on the night of her death, and he also said there
had been some talk of marriage between them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of marriage!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Temple, incredulously,
and at the same moment Mrs. Layton emitted a dismal
groan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wanted to be out of it; fling her off, I understand,&rdquo;
continued John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple, scornfully.
&ldquo;A girl of that class!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He should have remembered that when he made
love to her,&rdquo; remarked John, coolly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The depravity of the girl, to think of such a thing!&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Layton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean of marriage?&rdquo; smiled John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean of marriage with a young man in a perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
different position of life to her own, Mr. Temple,&rdquo;
replied Mrs. Layton, with injured dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet we have heard of such things,&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is but one end to such connections,&rdquo; groaned
Mrs. Layton, &ldquo;disgrace and shame, and in this case
death; in my opinion she deserved to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not believe Tom Henderson shot her,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said in his evidence he never went near the
place, and his groom corroborated this. He said he
got afraid to go, and that he intended writing to her
again to try and make some arrangement. Altogether
it is a very shady affair for him,&rdquo; replied John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Other young men have shady affairs, too, Mr.
Temple,&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple, with a toss of her handsome
head, and John&rsquo;s face turned a dusky red as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t all pose as perfection, you know, my
nephew John,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Temple. &ldquo;For my part
I do not intend to give up young Henderson&mdash;he is too
good-looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless they hang him,&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang him! Impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all impossible, I assure you. He will have
to prove he was not near the place, or he will run a
pretty good chance of it. I did not like the groom&rsquo;s
face; it was shifty, and he gave me the idea he was not
speaking the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your own evidence, Mr. Temple?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Layton. &ldquo;How did you account for your chance meeting
with Margaret Churchill at such an early hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By my love for the morning air, Mrs. Layton,&rdquo;
answered John, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret Churchill, in my opinion, is a most designing
young person,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Layton. &ldquo;Rachel,
my love, may I trouble you for a little more of that
delicious curry. Yes, a most designing young person.
I am told that she did everything to attract young
Henderson, and that her father also tried to entangle
him, and then when she had led the poor young man
on to a certain point, she turned round.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not believe he ever proposed for her,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Temple. &ldquo;I suppose you think her handsome?&rdquo;
she added, looking at John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she has a beautiful face,&rdquo; answered John,
decidedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful! That&rsquo;s a strong term,&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
Temple, scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet it is one I should apply to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may account, then, for your early walk, Mr.
Temple,&rdquo; said Mrs. Layton, with a little sneering laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My meeting with Miss Churchill was simply accidental,
Mrs. Layton,&rdquo; said John, coolly. &ldquo;Naturally
the poor girl, after such a dreadful discovery, stopped
the first person she met to tell him of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you knew her before?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Layton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had spoken to her before; I have bought a horse
of her father, and I saw her then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very convenient transaction for the Churchills,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Layton, with a sneer. &ldquo;She is a person with
no idea of her own position in life, I consider. Would
you believe it, I went the other day to the farm for the
purpose of buying some eggs, and when I asked Margaret
Churchill the price, she looked quite offended,
and said she did not sell eggs! Fancy a farmer&rsquo;s
daughter not selling eggs! However, she presented
me with a few, and I took them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very convenient transaction for you, Mrs. Layton,&rdquo;
scoffed John, who was getting out of temper, and
an angry gleam shot into Mrs. Layton&rsquo;s light eyes as
he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always do what I consider my duty, Mr. Temple,&rdquo;
she said, drawing up her spare little form. &ldquo;My husband
is fond of fresh-laid eggs, and as this misguided
young person would not sell them, I had to consider
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John made a sarcastic little bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wifely duty!&rdquo; he said; and Mrs. Layton always
spoke of him after this passage of arms with great
bitterness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a dangerous person,&rdquo; she remarked later in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the day to her daughter. &ldquo;Mark my words, Rachel, a
dangerous, designing person, and I believe he is carrying
on, or will carry on, an intrigue with Margaret
Churchill, and how would you like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate the whole lot of the Churchills!&rdquo; answered
Mrs. Temple, passionately. &ldquo;But his uncle will never
allow him to carry on an intrigue with this girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Rachel, you forget that your husband is
elderly, and that this young man is his heir,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Layton. &ldquo;I do not like to speak on unpleasant subjects,
but I think it my duty to tell you this, that when
at my earnest suggestion your father spoke to the
squire about settling the Hall, furniture, and carriages
on you for life, after poor little Phillip&rsquo;s death, that the
squire said he had no power to settle the Hall; that it
was entailed on the heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t, mother!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Temple, rising
in strong excitement, and beginning to pace the room.
&ldquo;I try to forget my darling&rsquo;s death; try to put it out of
my mind, or I think I should go mad, and now you
begin to harp on it again. Let everything go; what
matter is it when I have lost him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Rachel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has made me reckless,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Temple,
&ldquo;and I often wonder now, mother, where it will end.
But on the whole I rather like John Temple, and&mdash;he
must have nothing to do with this Churchill girl. I
will speak to Phillip about it. Both those boys played
in that fatal game&mdash;who knows? one of them may have
been my darling&rsquo;s murderer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She burst into passionate sobs as she ended this
speech, and her mother saw it was useless to say anything
more. When these fits of excitement came over
Rachel Temple, no one had the least control over her.
She became, as she had said, reckless, and in this mood
she continued the whole of the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile John Temple was against his will
being detained by his uncle, who had been out on business
in the morning, and only returned to the hall after
his wife and Mrs. Layton had left the luncheon table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>The squire, as the ladies had been, was eager to hear
all about the inquest, and John, though inwardly impatient
to start for Woodside, was obliged to go through
the whole details again to his uncle.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when he found himself
free, and then he at once proceeded to the farm. But
when he arrived there he found Mr. Churchill was from
home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will he be back?&rdquo; he inquired of the neat
maid-servant.</p>

<p>But as he spoke, May Churchill, who had been watching
for him, came across the hall from the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father was obliged to go out at four o&rsquo;clock, Mr.
Temple,&rdquo; she said in her sweet-toned voice, &ldquo;but I do
not think he will be very long away. Will you come in
and have some tea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John gladly accepted this invitation. He followed
May into the drawing-room, and sat there drinking tea
and looking in her fair face. It was a very pretty room,
sweet with flowers, and gracefully furnished. Everything
seemed to suit the young mistress, and John was
half-unconscious how long he stayed there. The
shadows began to lengthen, the sun dipped behind the
hills, and still he remained. Then presently the moon
rose, and still Mr. Churchill had not returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I tiring you?&rdquo; asked John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered May, with a smile and a blush.</p>

<p>John went across the room, and for a moment stood
looking out of the open window at the garden beyond,
on which now the cold, white moonbeams fell. May
had been leaning there before, and an irresistible
impulse seemed to draw him closer to her. It was one
of those moments when a strange subtle knowledge
comes to two human hearts. He bent his head until it
nearly touched the lovely face; he took a little fluttering
hand in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he half-whispered, and led her through the
casement which opened from the ground, to the silent
dewy garden outside. Pale fantastic shadows lay on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
flower and leaf, the breeze rustled through the lilac
bushes, and stirred the fruit-laden boughs. John forgot
everything but the sweet and strong emotion which
stirred his heart. He put his arm around the slight
girlish form; he drew her to his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear one,&rdquo; he murmured, and May felt too happy to
resist his caress. Her breath came short, her bosom
heaved, and her hand lingered tenderly in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mayflower,&rdquo; whispered John, &ldquo;may I call you by
that sweet name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came fluttering from May&rsquo;s rosy lips, and the
little monosyllable was breathed very near to John&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Click went the garden gate at this moment, and the
two heard it, and started quickly apart. Then a heavy,
determined footstep sounded on the gravel walk, and
a second or two later Mr. Churchill appeared. He
looked surprised but not displeased to see John Temple
with his daughter, and apologized for his absence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I waited as long as I could, Mr. Temple,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but I had some business I was forced to attend to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle delayed me,&rdquo; answered John, &ldquo;talking of
that unfortunate business; but,&rdquo; he added, smiling,
&ldquo;Miss Churchill has been very good; she has given me
some tea, and the night is so lovely we were taking
advantage of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered the farmer, &ldquo;but come in now
and have something to eat. I fear it is too late to go
down to the stables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will come over to-morrow and see the mare,&rdquo; said
John; &ldquo;but thanks, very much, I can not go in now.
Good-night Miss Churchill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill hospitably pressed him to go into the
house and have supper with them, but John declined.
He felt somehow that he could not eat. He was too
much excited, and those brief moments with May had
moved him deeply. He had realized for the first time
how dear she was to him; he knew now that he felt for
her what he had never felt for any woman before.</p>

<p>They shook hands and parted, and John walked home
alone in the moonlight. There was a delicious sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
life and love in his heart, and he smiled softly as he
went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she likes me,&rdquo; he was thinking; &ldquo;my little
country sweetheart&mdash;my country sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He repeated these words to himself again and again.
And again and again also he mentally saw the girl&rsquo;s
lovely profile on which the moonlight glimmered as she
stood in the window. It was a picture in his mind&rsquo;s
eye which never again faded away. There are such
pictures that Time&rsquo;s hand can not touch. And this was
one of them to John Temple; the sweet girlish face
glorified by the pale white beams.</p>

<p>When he reached the Hall dinner was over, but we
may be sure the heir was not allowed to suffer by this.
The butler speedily spread a tempting repast before
him, but John did not feel hungry still. He lit a cigar
and went out on the terrace, and there his excitement
sobered down. Other scenes rose up before him; other
hours of passion and love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a fool,&rdquo; he reflected; &ldquo;a girl&rsquo;s beautiful face
has made me feel like a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the girl with the beautiful face was
receiving a very unpleasant surprise. She had gone
into the house to order her father&rsquo;s supper with a new
feeling of joy and radiant hope glowing in her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He loves me,&rdquo; was the sweet thought that flushed
her smooth cheeks, and made her bright eyes sparkle.
May never doubted this after those brief moments in
the moonlight. And she felt a modest pride in the
thought. That this good-looking well-born gentleman
should care for her made her very happy. He was the
first man also that she had really liked. So pretty
a girl, of course, got admirers on every side. But
admiration does not necessarily win love. A woman
may feel flattered when her heart is totally untouched.</p>

<p>She ordered her father&rsquo;s supper therefore with a light
heart, and went into the dining-room to share it with
him gratified and glad. Mr. Churchill also seemed in
fairly good spirits, and ate his food with excellent appetite.
Then, when the meal was over, he commenced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
smoke, and May was just contemplating leaving the room
to indulge in her sweet thoughts alone, when her father
looked up and addressed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May, I went to see Mrs. Bradshaw this afternoon,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered May, somewhat indifferently, for
the subject of Mrs. Bradshaw was very unpleasant to
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we have fixed to be married to-morrow morning,&rdquo;
continued Mr. Churchill, in his quiet, determined
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning!&rdquo; echoed May, utterly surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what is the good of waiting? But it is to be
quite quiet; she did not wish you even to know until it
was over. But you have been a good little daughter to
me, and therefore I do not care to keep it a secret from
you, and I hope also you will be a good daughter to
your new mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May&rsquo;s face flushed painfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can never be a mother to me,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, that is folly. To-morrow she will be your
father&rsquo;s wife, and will take her place here, of course, as
mistress. And I hope you two will get on well together.
If you are wise you will do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May did not speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will only be away for a few days, a week at most,
as I shall have to be back, I suppose, for the adjourned
inquest. We are going to London, and if you are a good
girl I will bring you back a smart gown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But father&mdash;to-morrow you agreed&mdash;for Mr. Temple
to come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Temple must wait; I did not like to tell him I
was going to be married to-morrow when he proposed
to come. I will leave a note for him, and give orders
that he can have the mare over on trial whenever he
likes. Well, May, come and give me a kiss, and wish me
happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl rose up at her father&rsquo;s bidding and kissed his
brow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you happiness, father,&rdquo; she said, in a low, faltering
voice, and then she turned away and suddenly
left the room.</p>

<p>She went to her own, and stood at the window looking
out on the moonlit garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will this make any difference to him?&rdquo; she was
thinking, and a vague uneasiness stole into her heart.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>GOOD RESOLUTIONS.</small></h2>


<p>John Temple went early to Woodside the next morning,
after first making up his mind that he must indulge
in no more lovemaking to May Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair to the dear little girl,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;I was led away last night; any man would&mdash;a saint
would have been, and I am not a saint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kept this determination in his mind all the way to
the farm. He was going to see Mr. Churchill about his
horse, and not to look at the sweet Mayflower. Nevertheless,
his pulses beat a little more quickly when he
thought of her, and when he rang at the doorbell of the
house his heart was throbbing fast.</p>

<p>In answer to his inquiry if Mr. Churchill were within,
the maid replied, with rather a peculiar smile, that her
master had left home for some days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;he left a letter for you, sir, with
Miss Churchill, and she told me to tell you this if you
called.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then can I see Miss Churchill?&rdquo; asked John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; will you step this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John accordingly followed the maid to the dining-room,
and when she announced Mr. Temple, May rose
to receive him with a shy smile and a charming blush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I called to see your father about the horse,&rdquo; began
John as he took her pretty white fluttering hand in his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he left a letter for you,&rdquo; answered May; &ldquo;a&mdash;very
strange thing has happened, Mr. Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; asked John, smiling, and
thinking the while how lovely she looked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you left last night,&rdquo; and the blush deepened
as she spoke, &ldquo;he told me he was going away to be
married to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be married!&rdquo; echoed John, in great surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has upset me very much; I do not like the
person; I do not like it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you knew nothing about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told me a few days ago he was thinking of going
to be married again; but this is so sudden&mdash;I am very
much distressed about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not let it worry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t help it worrying me; I can&rsquo;t bear the
idea of it&mdash;it has made me very unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May was standing with her hand leaning on the back
of the chair from which she had risen at John&rsquo;s entrance,
and somehow it seemed only natural that he now should
put his brown hand over her white one in a consoling
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I can not bear to
think of you being unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; began May, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t allow you to be unhappy,&rdquo; continued John;
&ldquo;come, you must cheer up&mdash;you dear little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He really did not mean to do it, but when a man has
once nearly kissed a pretty girl, it seems very natural for
him to do it again. At all events John did kiss the lovely
blooming face before him, and all the rebuke he got was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mr. Temple, you should not do that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I should not,&rdquo; answered John, penitently;
&ldquo;but you are so sweet, so dear, I could not help myself&mdash;and
then you are unhappy, you know, so you must
forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am really unhappy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think about the horrid woman,&rdquo; consoled
John, taking the two pretty hands in his; &ldquo;think of
something else&mdash;think a little bit about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>The last few words were half-whispered, and they
seemed to console May somehow. She began to smile
again, and she looked softly at John, though she drew
her little hands away from his grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems such a thing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for him to forget
my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;well; he is only mortal, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then do you think everyone forgets, Mr. Temple?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think men&mdash;&rdquo; and then he paused. &ldquo;I know
someone that I never could forget,&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>May did not inquire who this &ldquo;someone&rdquo; was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone whose face I would dream of if I did not
see it for twenty years,&rdquo; went on John, energetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be changed in twenty years,&rdquo; replied May,
with a little sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in my eyes; in my eyes it could never change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the way in which John kept to his resolution.
They went into the garden awhile after this, and sat
listening to a black bird singing to his mate. Then
they went to May&rsquo;s fernery, and walked beneath the
shadow of the trees, and talked fond foolish words.
May forgot all about her father&rsquo;s marriage and her
hated stepmother. She was with the man she liked
best in all the world, and she believed he loved her.
What happiness is like this? The golden hours of youth
and hope; the vague foreshadowings of still greater joy.</p>

<p>Before they parted John had promised to call again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be so lonely,&rdquo; May had said softly, and how
could he leave her lonely? Yet he did not mean any
wrong; it was the drifting tide bearing him on to he
knew not where.</p>

<p>At all events during the next few days he went constantly
to Woodside. Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s marriage had
taken place, and the wealthy widow from Castle Hill
would, no doubt, soon be installed at the farm. May
tried not to think of it, and she tried also to tell herself
that she must not think seriously of Mr. Temple. But
do what she would she did think of him. After all, if
he really loved her, would not that sweep away the
social difference between them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>And he did love her. May felt sure of this, and this
surety alone brought her great happiness. People
might try to separate them; his uncle probably would
try, but true love can overcome all obstacles. In these
sweet dreams the girl lived during the few days following
her father&rsquo;s marriage. Then the time for the
adjourned inquest approached, and in due course May
received a letter from her father to tell her that on the
following evening that he and his newly-made wife
would arrive at Woodside.</p>

<p>The preparations for this event were intensely disagreeable
to May. John Temple also heard the news
with great annoyance. No more quiet walks in the
lonely garden then; no more tender hand-clasps, nor
long, uninterrupted interviews. He gathered from
May that her stepmother was not a lady; that she was
bustling and interfering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is better,&rdquo; John told himself.</p>

<p>May&rsquo;s two young brothers, Hal and Willie Churchill,
had been away for their holidays for a week or two
also during this time, so that John Temple and the
Mayflower practically had been able to see each other
whenever they liked. They knew now this state of
things would end. The boys were coming home; Mr.
and Mrs. Churchill were on the point of arriving, and
moreover, John Temple had received a hint from his
uncle that his visits to Woodside Farm had been
remarked on, and that it would be well that they
should cease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can end in nothing, you know, John,&rdquo; the squire
had said, not unkindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly it will end in nothing, uncle,&rdquo; answered
John, gravely. &ldquo;I think, if you do not mind, after the
adjourned inquest on that poor girl is over, I will leave
Woodlea for a month or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, you are your own master, and must
guide your own actions,&rdquo; said the squire; &ldquo;only I do
not think it quite fair to this pretty girl that you should
pay her so much attention when you can not marry
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can not marry her,&rdquo; replied John, and after
this the subject was not mentioned again, but the conversation
was not without effect on John Temple.</p>

<p>So he went to see May for the last time before her
stepmother&rsquo;s arrival in a very sober frame of mind. It
was a dull, wet day, and when May saw him crossing
the garden she went to open the house door for him,
and gave him her hand with a warm clasp of welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for coming to cheer me, as I feel so
dreadfully dull,&rdquo; she said, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel dreadfully dull, too,&rdquo; answered John, putting
down his wet umbrella and hat on the hall stand, and
the next moment he put his hand through the girl&rsquo;s
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come into the drawing-room,&rdquo; said May, softly; &ldquo;I
have been making it all smart, and there is a fire there;
it is so wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They crossed the hall thus, John lightly leaning on
May&rsquo;s arm, and entered the drawing-room together.
There was a bright fire burning in the grate, and the
room was fresh and sweet with flowers. Altogether
May had done her best to make it look cheerful, but
still John felt very dull.</p>

<p>May went up to the fire, and John held out his chilled
hands to the blaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you expect these people to arrive?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father said about six o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied May.</p>

<p>John took out his watch and looked at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just four now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I must go by five;
only one hour, May!&rdquo;</p>

<p>May sighed softly, and John turned round and looked
at her earnestly, and then also sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last few days have been very bright, haven&rsquo;t
they, May?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; half-whispered May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too bright, I am afraid,&rdquo; went on John; &ldquo;it will
make the coming ones seem dull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There may be some bright ones still,&rdquo; said May, in
a low tone, with downcast eyes and blushing cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Again John looked at her. How pretty she was in
her white frock and crimson ribbons! She had a crimson
rose in her waistband and another at her throat.
&ldquo;Truly a fair picture,&rdquo; John was thinking, and it was
hard, very hard, to say the word he meant to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going away, May, for a bit,&rdquo; he said at length,
with an effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going away?&rdquo; repeated the girl quickly, and her
face flushed, and then grew a little pale, and John saw
this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on John, still with an effort, &ldquo;I think I
shall go abroad for a month or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May did not speak; her pallor increased, and her
agitation was visible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I shall never forget Woodside,&rdquo; said John, after
a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;nor you&mdash;Mayflower&mdash;I wish I
could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked May, in a trembling voice, and she put
out her hand as if for support.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I would be happier if I could,&rdquo; answered
John, also much moved; &ldquo;I will pay a bitter price, I am
afraid, for the bright hours I have spent with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do not go away, Mr. Temple!&rdquo; cried May, suddenly,
looking at him with imploring eyes. &ldquo;I&mdash;I shall
be so lonely&mdash;I shall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must try to forget all this,&rdquo; said John, and he
put his arm around her and pressed his lips on hers.
&ldquo;Dear little girl&mdash;dear Mayflower&mdash;it is hard, it is
bitter to go from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears rushed into May&rsquo;s eyes, and John kissed them
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not grieve, darling,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;it would
make me more sad if I thought I had done any harm
to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will come back?&rdquo; said May, in a broken
voice.</p>

<p>John did not speak. He did not mean to come back,
but he could not bear to see her distress. He kissed
her again; he called her by every endearing name, and
May put her hand in his and held it fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise me to come back,&rdquo; she whispered, with her
cheek against his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; said John, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, for
he felt he could not resist her appeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do not quite forget me when you are away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget you!&rdquo; cried John, and he caught her passionately
to his breast; &ldquo;would that I could, May! It would
be better for you and me&mdash;but the die is cast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was still in his arms, with her head on his breast,
when the sound of carriage wheels on the gravel outside
was distinctly heard in the room. May lifted her
head and gave a cry; John looked sharply around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is your father, whatever shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>May, girl-like, ran to the mirror; John, man-like, stood
helpless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My hair is not very disorderly, is it?&rdquo; she said, trying
to smooth her soft bright curls. &ldquo;How odious that
they should come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; asked John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay until they come in, and then I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go&mdash;good-by, dear May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He clasped her hand for a moment, and then May
went to the door to receive her father and his bride.
Mrs. Churchill was already in the hall, and was giving
orders to the coachman and servants about her
luggage; Mr. Churchill was giving orders about the
horses.</p>

<p>As May went forward Mrs. Churchill saw her, and
advanced toward her and kissed her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;here we are. We have
had a wet day to travel in, but it makes it all the pleasanter
to get home. And how are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was a good-looking, middle-aged woman; robust
and dark, with marked dark eyebrows, and a firm, hard
mouth. She looked a person of strong will also; somehow
her very voice told you this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; she called out in a loud tone to her husband,
&ldquo;here is your daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this Mr. Churchill came into the hall, and
kissed May also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; he said, kindly, &ldquo;and how have you
been getting on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Temple is in the drawing-room, father,&rdquo; said
May, nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;the squire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. John Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But John by this time had appeared. He went up to
Mr. Churchill and shook hands with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Churchill, I hear I have to congratulate
you,&rdquo; he said, with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Temple,&rdquo; answered the farmer.
&ldquo;Sarah, my dear, this is Mr. John Temple, our landlord&rsquo;s
nephew and heir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this Mrs. Churchill bowed graciously, and after
a few more pleasant words, John Temple went away.
Then Mrs. Churchill began bustling about the house as
if she had lived in it for twenty years. She remarked
on the furniture, and decided where she would place
her own &ldquo;things,&rdquo; as she called them. She made no
pretense about consulting May in any of her arrangements,
but took her place at once as mistress of the
house and all that it contained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what matter,&rdquo; thought May, softly, as she stood
looking out on the still garden on the night of her stepmother&rsquo;s
arrival at Woodside. &ldquo;What matter does
anything here now make to me?&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>MAY&rsquo;S STEPMOTHER.</small></h2>


<p>The next time that May saw John Temple was at the
adjourned inquest on the death of Elsie Wray. They
both then simply repeated their former evidence, and
the only fresh witness on the occasion was Mrs.
Henderson.</p>

<p>In faltering and broken words the unhappy mother
told what she knew to be untrue. Her son had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
been out for a very short time on the night of Miss Wray&rsquo;s
death, she said, and he had returned to the house much
earlier than usual. He said he had just been down to
the stables, and spoke about the horses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know of any engagement existing between
your son and Miss Wray?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I did not,&rdquo; truthfully replied Mrs. Henderson.</p>

<p>She was then questioned as to the time of Tom
Henderson&rsquo;s return to the house, but, though very nervous,
she had carefully prepared her story. If her
evidence and the evidence of the groom, Jack Reid,
were true, it was impossible that Henderson could have
been in the neighborhood of Fern Dene. At all events
the jury gave him the benefit of the doubt. They
returned a verdict that Elsie Wray had destroyed her own
life when in a state of temporary insanity, and though
every one in the room believed that this condition of
mind had been brought on by the conduct of young
Henderson, there were some ready to blame the poor
girl for her folly in fixing her affections on a man so
superior in rank to herself.</p>

<p>Among these was Mr. Churchill of Woodside, and
after the inquest was over, as Henderson was handing
his mother into the dog-cart, Mr. Churchill, in passing to
seek his own trap, held out his hand to Henderson, and
then to Mrs. Henderson, who was trembling visibly.
He only said a word or two about the weather, but his
manner showed a certain amount of sympathy and
kindness which was very welcome to both mother and
son.</p>

<p>May Churchill, on the other hand, who was following
her father, passed them with downcast eyes. She
scarcely, indeed, noticed them. A moment or two
before she had had a brief interview with John
Temple, and he had slipped a note into her hand, and
she was thinking of this note and of his words, and not
of the Hendersons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come to say good-by,&rdquo; John Temple had
said, in a low tone, clasping her hand and leaving the
note there at the same time; &ldquo;this will explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When&mdash;&rdquo; began May, much agitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; replied John, who understood, and answering
her unspoken question, &ldquo;but&mdash;I will not forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not another word was exchanged between them.
Mr. Churchill called to his daughter to come to him,
and several people were around them, but May saw no
one, and heard no words but John&rsquo;s. He did not follow
her to her father&rsquo;s dog-cart, but he stood watching
her as her father helped her in, and when May turned
to look at him he lifted his hat.</p>

<p>Thus they parted, and May went back to Woodside
feeling both agitated and depressed. But she had her
letter! With this firmly clasped in her hand she sprang
from the dog-cart and ran upstairs to her own room
without waiting to speak to her stepmother, who was
standing in the hall to receive her husband.</p>

<p>When May reached her room she tore open John&rsquo;s
letter with trembling fingers, and read the following
words, failing at the time to comprehend their full
meaning:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear May&mdash;Sweet Mayflower</span>: I am writing
this because I think it right to do so; I am going
away because I also think it right. I want you, in my
absence, fully to comprehend your feelings toward me.
If two people truly love each other I think nothing
should separate them, but in the mutual attraction
between men and women there is much which is not
the love that can not change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear child, dear sweetheart! you are so much
younger than I am that I must warn you against
myself. I am world-worn, and until I met you I could
not have believed that such a deep, tender, and passionate
affection as I feel for you could have arisen in
my heart. Yet this is so, but, on the other hand, there
are strong and powerful reasons to keep us apart.
You must make your own decision when I return. In
the meantime believe that I love you, and that I am
ready to sacrifice much for your love.</p>

<p class="right">&rdquo;<span class="smcap">John Temple.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>May read and re-read this letter, and could not quite
follow its drift. She naturally thought that the strong
and powerful reasons to keep them apart were social
ones. His uncle, of course, would naturally object to
his heir marrying the daughter of one of his tenants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he loves me,&rdquo; May whispered softly to herself;
&ldquo;and I love him, and will sacrifice anything for his
sake&mdash;mine is the love that can not change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But her sweet dream was speedily interrupted. Her
stepmother&rsquo;s loud voice was heard calling to her on the
stairs:</p>

<p>&ldquo;May! dinner is ready; come down at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May had still her hat and cape on, and it took her a
few minutes to divest herself of these, but when she
went into the dining-room she found her stepmother
had not waited for her. Mrs. Churchill was sitting
carving a large boiled leg of mutton and turnips, and
she looked at May with her bright dark eyes disapprovingly
as she entered the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are late for dinner, May,&rdquo; she said, sharply.
May made no answer. She sat down at the table, but the
two thick slices of boiled mutton that her stepmother
handed her was impossible food for her. In fact she
could not eat it, and played with a little potato.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you not eating your mutton?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not like boiled mutton,&rdquo; replied May, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not like excellent boiled mutton! Then what do
you like? I did not know you were such a dainty eater
as that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May never eats very much,&rdquo; said her father, kindly
enough; &ldquo;you like birds best, don&rsquo;t you, May?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; answered May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to have birds every day,&rdquo; remarked
her stepmother, decidedly, and then nothing more was
said on the subject, and May went without her dinner,
for which, however, she did not care.</p>

<p>But she did care about her stepmother&rsquo;s constant
interference. She had been accustomed to be her own
mistress for years; to go out when it pleased her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
to read or write just as it took her fancy. Now Mrs.
Churchill wished to change all this. She insisted on
her going out shopping with herself; she found fault
with her dress; and when she read, said she was wasting
her time.</p>

<p>May tried for her father&rsquo;s sake to put up with all this,
but it was very annoying; then the two boys, Willie and
Hal, returned home, and Mrs. Churchill tried to manage
them also. Willie, who was a spoilt, rather passionate
boy, was furious, but Hal suggested that as she kept the
key of the jam closet, they had better be civil.</p>

<p>Then another disturbing element arose in the household
for May. This was no less than the renewal of
Tom Henderson&rsquo;s now most unwelcome attentions.
Henderson&rsquo;s passion for her had by no means diminished
in the changed circumstances of his life. Nay, he told
himself that it was for her sake that he had acted as he
had done. And taking advantage of Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s
known love for making a good bargain, he arrived at
Woodside one day under the excuse that he wanted to
buy a horse.</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill received the would-be purchaser quite
civilly. And Henderson gave a long price for a very
ordinary animal. Mr. Churchill was so pleased that he
invited the young man into the house to have a glass of
wine, and Henderson was only too delighted to avail
himself of the chance of once more seeing May.</p>

<p>And he did see her, and also her stepmother. Mrs.
Churchill was a shrewd woman, and her sharp, dark
eyes speedily perceived that Henderson was deeply in
love with May. He sat with his handsome dark eyes
fixed on her fair face during the whole time he was in
the room, and after he was gone Mrs. Churchill made
particular inquiries about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is the young man, is he, for
whose sake that foolish girl at the Wayside Inn shot
herself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt he behaved very badly to her,&rdquo;
replied May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you possibly tell that, my dear? A girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
in her position could not expect him to marry her; he is
a very nice, fine-looking young man. Does he often
come here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He used to come a great deal,&rdquo; said May, coldly, and
then she left the room, but Mrs. Churchill did not forget
the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; she said, the same night to her husband,
&ldquo;do you know I believe that young Henderson admires
May extremely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to think so too,&rdquo; answered Mr. Churchill, who
was smoking his pipe complacently, and thinking of the
good bargain he had made in the morning; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s
rather an awkward business, about that girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will soon be forgotten, and I think it would
be a remarkably good match for May, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill gave one or two more puffs at his pipe
before he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stourton is nice property,&rdquo; he said, at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he&rsquo;s a nice-looking young man, suitable in
age and everything, and girls are far better married
young. I would encourage him to come here if I were
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Henderson needed very little encouragement to
go to Woodside. He began to do so from the day he
had bought the horse, and he made very little secret of
what was his attraction, and after awhile Mrs. Churchill
made up her mind to bring the affair to a conclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May,&rdquo; she said, quietly, after one of Henderson&rsquo;s visits,
&ldquo;I think there is no doubt what that young man
comes here for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May did not reply. She had always been very cold and
distant to Henderson since Elsie Wray&rsquo;s death, but she
also knew very well the reason why he came to Woodside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both your father and I think it would be an excellent
match for you,&rdquo; continued her stepmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing would induce me to marry him,&rdquo; answered
May, quickly and sharply, and Mrs. Churchill saw a hot
flush rise to her lovely skin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, it is folly to talk in that way. Girls in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
these things must be guided by their elders, their parents.
I married before I was your age, and I married
because my father and mother wished me to do so, not
that I was what is called in love with poor Mr. Jones.
He, however, made me an excellent husband, and left
me in comfortable circumstances. Mr. Henderson is
well off, and it is your duty to your father to accept
him, as, of course, your keep is a great expense to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has my father complained of the expense I am to
him?&rdquo; asked May, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has not absolutely complained, but he is naturally
anxious that you should settle and marry well. He
was speaking to me about it only yesterday. He is not a
rich man, and has, of course, many expenses. We both
think young Henderson is the very man for you, and as
he has a nice, independent property, it is an exceedingly
good match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never marry him,&rdquo; repeated May; &ldquo;please do
not mention this again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mrs. Churchill did mention it again. She dwelt
on it. It became her pet subject of conversation, and
on one occasion when May was out, she&mdash;as she
expressed it&mdash;&ldquo;sounded&rdquo; Mr. Henderson on his intentions
toward her stepdaughter.</p>

<p>The young man did not require a second hint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would give anything to marry her, Mrs. Churchill,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;but May gives me no opportunity of speaking
to her alone; she has changed to me since&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A strange pallor spread over Henderson&rsquo;s handsome
face as he left his sentence incomplete, and Mrs. Churchill
instantly observed this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since that poor girl committed suicide, I suppose you
mean?&rdquo; she said, calmly. &ldquo;It was an unfortunate occurrence,
no doubt, but one that I think no sensible woman
could blame you for. You could not be expected to
marry her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson gave a kind of gasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say that, Mrs. Churchill,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but perhaps May&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, May will get over it. Come and have tea with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
us to-morrow, Mr. Henderson, and I will give you the
opportunity of speaking to May alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson was only too glad to promise to avail
himself of this invitation. And on the following day
he arrived at Woodside, excited and eager. And after
tea was over Mrs. Churchill proceeded to carry out her
little plan. She sent May into the garden alone, under
the pretense that she wanted her to gather some
flowers, and presently she sent young Henderson after
her.</p>

<p>May was in the very act of cutting some roses when
she heard his step on the walk behind her, and she was
returning to the house to avoid him, when he suddenly
caught her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, May,&rdquo; he said, in an agitated manner, &ldquo;I
want a few words with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am busy,&rdquo; answered May, &ldquo;I can not stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must stay,&rdquo; went on Henderson, almost roughly.
&ldquo;May, how long is this to go on? How long are you
going to play with me as you are playing with me
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never played with you, Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; said
May, with some dignity of manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you did. But play or not play, will you
listen to what I have got to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to listen, Mr. Henderson; nothing that
you can have to say to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drive me mad, May!&rdquo; cried the young man,
passionately. &ldquo;You know I love you; that I love you
too well, and yet you are always cold to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry if&mdash;if you care for me&mdash;for I can give
you nothing in return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Henderson, it is best to speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your parents wish it,&rdquo; interrupted Henderson,
eagerly; &ldquo;your mother sent me to speak to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no mother,&rdquo; said May, raising her head,
proudly; &ldquo;if you mean my father&rsquo;s wife, she has no
right to interfere with my affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this is all you have to say to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, except to hope you will never speak of this to
me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A half-suppressed oath broke from Henderson&rsquo;s lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You carry things with a high hand, I must say; but
if this means that that fellow Temple has come between
you and me, he had best take care! No one shall come
between us&mdash;you have cost me too much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An evil look came over his face as he spoke&mdash;such
an evil look that May half-shuddered and hurried away,
and as she entered the house she met her stepmother
in the hall, who looked at her searchingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Mr. Henderson? Has he spoken to
you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>May felt very angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would not send Mr. Henderson to speak
to me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I told you it was no use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a foolish girl, and you should not speak to
me in that manner,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has annoyed me very much,&rdquo; continued May,
&ldquo;about these things. I may certainly be allowed to
manage my own affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see, but you are very impertinent, and I
shall speak to your father about your conduct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May said nothing more. She went to her own room,
and after locking the door sat down to do what she did
every hour of the day&mdash;to think of John Temple. Oh!
how she longed for his return. She had made her
decision; the decision that he had asked for in his
letter, and was ready to brave everything for his sake.
But he had been gone nearly a month, and she had
heard nothing of or from him. Still she did not doubt
his word nor his love. He would come back and then
how different everything would seem.</p>

<p>But she had not heard the last of young Henderson&rsquo;s
visit. When she went down to supper both her father
and her stepmother received her very coldly. Then
when the meal was over her father spoke to her very
seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May,&rdquo; he said, after he had taken a few puffs at his
pipe, &ldquo;your mother tells me you have been acting very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
foolishly and not treating her with the respect which is
her due, and which I will insist on from everyone in
this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you mean about Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; answered May,
turning very red, &ldquo;I refuse to have anything to say to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should take the advice of those older than
yourself; your mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Churchill is not my mother,&rdquo; said May, hotly;
&ldquo;poor mother, I am sure, would never have urged me
to encourage a man with Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill got very angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so impertinent, girl!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you what it is, May, if you go on in this way you may
find another home for yourself, for I won&rsquo;t have you
in mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, father, I will,&rdquo; answered May, and she
rose and left the room, and the husband and wife were
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you have spoilt her, William,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll unspoil her, then,&rdquo; swore the farmer. &ldquo;I can
not think what&rsquo;s come over her of late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the first serious quarrel that May had ever
had with her father. Mr. Churchill was, indeed, both
fond and proud of her. But his new wife had already
gained a strong influence over him. She was a clever
woman in her way, and good-looking, and very well off,
all of which qualifications Mr. Churchill thought much
of, and of the last the most. Therefore, the next day
he scarcely spoke to May, and her position in the house
was exceedingly disagreeable.</p>

<p>But on the day following there came a change. It
was Sunday, and May went to church with her two
young brothers, her father and stepmother remaining
at home, as Mrs. Churchill had a cold. And when May
lifted her eyes, and looked at the squire&rsquo;s square pew,
she saw seated there John Temple and Mrs. Temple,
his uncle&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>THE PICTURE HAT.</small></h2>


<p>The squire of Woodlea&rsquo;s pew was at one side of the
old-fashioned country church, and Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s family
occupied seats in the gallery. Therefore John Temple,
looking up, saw the entrance of May Churchill and the
two boys, and saw also the blush, the look of unmistakable
joy, with which she recognized himself.</p>

<p>Other eyes saw this, too; a pair of handsome dark
eyes that belonged to Mrs. Temple, who had followed
her nephew-in-law&rsquo;s upward glance, and watched, half
with amusement, half with scorn, his brown face color
slightly, and a soft look steal over his good-looking
face. She also had seen the entrance of the three
young Churchills, and drew her own conclusions from
John&rsquo;s expression. He had only arrived at the Hall
the evening before, and had in the morning expressed
a wish to attend the service at the parish church, somewhat
to Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought going to church would not have been in
your way,&rdquo; she had said at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never heard your father preach,&rdquo; answered
John, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will fall asleep during the sermon&mdash;I warn
you,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple, also smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a bad sleeper, so that will be delightful,&rdquo; said
John.</p>

<p>The squire was ailing, and had a cold, and therefore
did not go to church, so Mrs. Temple and John alone
occupied the Hall pew. And when she saw the look on
May Churchill&rsquo;s face, and the look on John Temple&rsquo;s
as their eyes met, she understood why her husband&rsquo;s
nephew had wished to hear her father preach. That
look indeed had thrilled through both their hearts.
Yet, as John&rsquo;s eyes fell, he sighed softly, and Mrs.
Temple heard the sigh.</p>

<p>But May did not sigh. He had come back; she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
see him again, and when she did see him she would
tell him she had made the decision he had asked for.
She sat there between her two young brothers with her
heart beating tumultuously, beating with joy and hope.</p>

<p>Presently Hal Churchill gave a little kick at her
small foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, May,&rdquo; he said in a loud whisper, bending his
head toward his sister&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye see who&rsquo;s in the
squire&rsquo;s pew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>May made no answer. She frowned, or rather pretended
to frown, and Hal went on unabashed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard he&rsquo;d come back last night, but forgot to tell
you,&rdquo; continued Hal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horrid boy,&rdquo; thought May, remembering some
sleepless hours she had spent grieving over John
Temple&rsquo;s absence.</p>

<p>The service went on; the weak-eyed curate, who also
admired May Churchill, looked up to the gallery
occasionally, and so did Mrs. Layton. This good lady
repeated the responses in a loud tone, so as to let all
those around her know how pious she was, yet she was
not above worldly thoughts at the same time. She disapproved
of May Churchill&rsquo;s picture hat and picture
face. She was wondering what the world was coming
to when tenant farmers&rsquo; daughters dressed as May was
dressed. She repeated, &ldquo;Have mercy upon us miserable
sinners,&rdquo; but she did not really include herself in that
category. She prayed for her neighbors, but not for
herself, and she was greatly troubled in spirit concerning
May Churchill&rsquo;s picture hat.</p>

<p>Presently the vicar ascended the pulpit, and in his
usual monotonous under-tone proceeded with his usual
platitudes. A worthy man this, but misty, and perhaps
his brain was mercifully clouded. It made his daily
life more bearable, his scolding eager wife more endurable,
and, taking all things into consideration, it was
well for the Rev. James that he was not a clever nor
keen-eyed man. His congregation, who expected nothing
new from him, each settled him or herself to their
private thoughts. The men, as a rule, mentally did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
their weekly accounts over, the women the cost of their
neighbor&rsquo;s dress and their own proposed new personal
adornments. John Temple moved his seat to a convenient
corner, whispering smilingly to his aunt-in-law
as he passed her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true, I am actually going to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple smiled in return, and looked at John as
he closed his eyes and leaned back his head against
the curtained pew. But though he closed his eyes he
did not go to sleep, nor had the slightest inclination to
do so. Through those closed lids he still mentally saw
the lovely face in the gallery beyond; still saw the glad
look with which the Mayflower had greeted his return.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple noticed his face flush, though he never
opened his eyes. She kept looking at him and wondering
what his life had been before her own terrible loss
had made him the heir of Woodlea. She had expected
to dislike him, almost to hate him, but she did not. His
good looks favorably influenced her for one thing, and
his pleasant, sympathetic manner for another. There
is really no such lasting charm as this. But it is born
with the man or woman who possesses it. It is the reflection
from their hearts as it were; the outcome of the
inner sense that understands the feelings of others and
never wounds them.</p>

<p>John Temple possessed this gift, to some extent at
least, though not in the highest sense. But at all events
he never said unsuitable things, nor hit the wrong nail
on the head. Some people seemingly can not help doing
this. With the best intentions they ruffle our tempers,
and we are glad when they go out of our sight.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Temple kept looking at John, and speculating
as to his past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is good-looking, but scarcely handsome,&rdquo; she
thought, and then she sighed, and her memory went
back to the days of her soldier-lover, now lying in his
Indian grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had married George Hill, I would have been a
good woman,&rdquo; she was thinking. &ldquo;Now what have I
to be good for?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>She glanced contemptuously, as the thought struck
her first, at her poor misty father in the pulpit, and
then at her eager, watchful mother in the vicar&rsquo;s pew
below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They sold me,&rdquo; she was reflecting, &ldquo;and what I can
give them is all they care for. Ah, it is a weary world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She moved, so impatiently that John Temple opened
his gray eyes. The sermon was now drawing to a close,
for one good quality the Rev. James Layton really did
possess was not to preach too long sermons. And the
moment the blessing was over Mrs. Temple rose hastily
and signed to John to follow her. She wished to leave
the church before her mother had an opportunity of joining
her, for Mrs. Layton seldom ordered a Sunday dinner,
but in general, and always if she could manage it,
dined when the family at the Hall had luncheon in the
middle of the day.</p>

<p>John looked up at the gallery as he followed Mrs.
Temple out of the church, and half-smiled as his eyes
met May&rsquo;s, and this smile was reflected on her rosy lips.
A moment later Mrs. Layton also looked up over her
clasped hands, and to her consternation when she
glanced at her daughter&rsquo;s pew, she saw she was gone.
Then she rose hastily from her knees and hurried out
by the vestry door, only to be in time to see the Hall
carriage disappear out of the churchyard, with her
daughter and John Temple seated in it.</p>

<p>She ran to the churchyard gate; she frantically waved
her umbrella, but all in vain. Mrs. Temple either did
not, or pretended not to see her mother, and with a
rueful heart Mrs. Layton had to turn and face the out-coming
congregation, who were greatly amused at her
discomfiture.</p>

<p>And she had very good cause for this feeling. She
had in fact ordered no dinner for herself nor her husband
at the vicarage, having securely reckoned on lunching
at the Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rachel should be ashamed of herself,&rdquo; she reflected,
angrily, as she returned to the vestry, &ldquo;to treat her parents
so, after all I have done for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Only broken her daughter&rsquo;s heart! This was what
Mrs. Layton had done, and she considered her conduct
meritorious. But she had no time for further reflection.
In the vestry the vicar was divesting himself of
his limp surplice, and his wife felt she must act.</p>

<p>&ldquo;James,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am just going to walk over to
the Hall for lunch, and you must follow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Rachel ask us?&rdquo; inquired the vicar, weakly, for
he also had been looking forward to the good things
on the squire&rsquo;s table, and a glass or two of the squire&rsquo;s
good wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Layton, mendaciously, &ldquo;but I
stayed behind to tell you not to be long. I will walk
on, as they always have lunch much earlier on Sundays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mrs. Layton did walk on. She went at a brisk
rate, for she was determined not to be cheated out
of her dinner by her ungrateful daughter. She therefore
arrived at the Hall somewhat heated in mind and
body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The family are at lunch, madam,&rdquo; the footman who
opened the door informed her, but, nothing daunted,
Mrs. Layton walked coolly to the dining-room, and
entered unannounced.</p>

<p>The gray-haired squire, who was sitting at the table,
rose to receive her, after giving one inquiring glance
at his wife, who shrugged her shoulders slightly in
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wished to see you, Rachel,&rdquo; began Mrs. Layton,
who was very hot, &ldquo;but you hurried away from church
so quickly that I had not the opportunity, and so I followed
you on here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray be seated, Mrs. Layton,&rdquo; said Mr. Temple,
courteously. &ldquo;James,&rdquo; this was to the footman, &ldquo;place
a chair for Mrs. Layton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must say I feel rather tired,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Layton,
&ldquo;and shall be glad of a glass of wine. Thanks, Mr.
Temple, I know your good wine of old, and I hope you
will excuse me when I tell you that I have taken the
liberty of asking the vicar to follow me here. I wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
to see you, Rachel, on a little business that I could not
defer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say it would have waited,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
Temple, coolly. She was annoyed at her mother&rsquo;s
appearance, and she did not care to hide this, nor did
she extend any warm welcome to her father when the
good vicar came shambling in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother said you had kindly invited us, my
dear,&rdquo; explained the vicar. &ldquo;I am sorry I am late, but
there were several things I had to see about before I
could leave the vestry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is all right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple. At this
moment she felt sorry for her poor down-trodden father.
She heaped good things on his plate, and ordered some
of his favorite old port to be placed on the table. She
took very little notice of her mother; she had in truth
an immense contempt for the scheming, untruthful
little woman who had given her birth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Layton still felt angry, but her anger did not
interfere with her appetite. She ate and drank to her
heart&rsquo;s content, and then she began talking to John
Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you were at church this morning, Mr. John?&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a poor place, and needs a great
deal of alteration, but all these things cost money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The squire turned a deaf ear to his mother-in-law&rsquo;s
remark, but John answered courteously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it all seemed very nice,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Of course, you can not expect everything in an old-fashioned
country church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, old-fashioned, that is the word,&rdquo; echoed Mrs.
Layton, eagerly. &ldquo;Look at those galleries! Did you
ever see such things? They should come down, but
as I said before it all costs money, and people won&rsquo;t
give it, and the vicar won&rsquo;t rouse himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vicar looked mildly up from his plate at this
remark, and that was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And talking of the galleries,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Layton,
speaking with great rapidity, &ldquo;did you notice that
absurd hat that Margaret Churchill wore this morning?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Absolutely preposterous! I suppose that is what you
call a picture hat?&rdquo; she added, looking at her daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it seemed a very elegant affair!&rdquo; scoffed
Mrs. Temple. &ldquo;What did you think of it, my nephew
John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be shocked at my bad taste when I confess I
never noticed it,&rdquo; replied John Temple, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You only saw the face beneath?&rdquo; questioned Mrs.
Temple.</p>

<p>John made a sarcastic bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you compliment my good taste,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, people call her handsome, and she may be
good-looking; I suppose she is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Layton,
viciously, &ldquo;but I have a very poor opinion of Margaret
Churchill. If you believe it, I am told she is now once
more endeavoring to entangle young Henderson of
the Grange, in spite of the terrible scandal about him.
I hear they invite him to the house, and that he buys
horses of the old man, and that the new Mrs. Churchill
is bent on the match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple felt a strong wave of anger rise in his
heart, but he prudently checked it before it reached his
tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, rising from the table, &ldquo;I will leave
you two ladies for the present, if Mrs. Temple will
excuse me? I have some letters to write, and afterward
I think I shall go out; it is too fine a day to spend
indoors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, please yourself,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple,
carelessly. She did not like John leaving her thus, to
be bored by her mother&rsquo;s company, but she stood on
small ceremony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tired; I will lie down and read in my own
room for an hour or two, I think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Good-day,
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She just extended the tips of her slender fingers to
Mrs. Layton as she spoke, and then rose languidly and
left the room.</p>

<p>The squire was thus left alone with the vicar and his
mother-in-law. But he also was tired of both. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
retired into an easy chair, and put his handkerchief
over his face to announce that he wanted a little rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see you want a little doze, squire,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Layton, observing this. &ldquo;Well, James,&rdquo; she continued,
addressing her husband, &ldquo;I will just take another glass
of port and then we must be off. It&rsquo;s well for those
who can afford to take rest, but a poor parson and his
wife can not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The squire made no reply to this, and Mrs. Layton,
having drank her port, took her leave, remarking to her
husband as they quitted the house together:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor man, he is evidently failing fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank heavens she is gone!&rdquo; exclaimed the squire
with energy, pulling the handkerchief from his face as
he heard their retreating footsteps. &ldquo;What a woman!
She&rsquo;s enough to drive anyone mad.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>THE LOVE THAT CAN NOT CHANGE.</small></h2>


<p>John Temple went up the staircase toward his own
room, after quitting the luncheon, saying some very
hard things indeed below his breath of Mrs. Layton.
She had made him intensely angry about May Churchill
and young Henderson. Not that he believed a word of
it, but it enraged him to hear the girl&rsquo;s name coupled
with this ruffian&rsquo;s, for so he mentally designated Henderson.</p>

<p>John indeed had always had serious doubts as to
Henderson&rsquo;s actual guilt regarding Elsie Wray&rsquo;s death.
That he had broken the poor girl&rsquo;s heart he never
doubted. But there had been something in the evidence
of the groom, Jack Reid, something in his face
that made John believe he was not speaking the truth.</p>

<p>And that Henderson dare go near May! &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that
disgusting stepmother, I suppose,&rdquo; thought John; &ldquo;my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
poor little girl, my poor May, you will be happier with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So John sat down to write to his poor little May when
he got to his own room, and then started out across the
park to post his letter at the nearest post office. He
walked on with a bent head and a thoughtful brow.
He was dissatisfied with himself, irresolute, and yet
his heart was warm with love. In his letter he had
asked May to fix some place where he could see her,
but he was fated to meet her earlier than he expected.</p>

<p>May and her brothers had walked home from church,
May feeling somewhat disappointed that she had not
had an opportunity of exchanging a word with John
Temple, but still she was ready to excuse him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could not help himself; he was obliged to go
with his uncle&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; she told herself. But still it
made her a little sad. It marked the social difference
between them, as it were. If she had been his equal,
and John had meant to make her his wife, he would
assuredly have lingered to speak to her. As it was he
could not help himself, but May sighed when she
thought of it.</p>

<p>Then, when they reached home, Mrs. Churchill made
herself purposely very unpleasant to her stepdaughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very absurd hat of yours, May,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the folks in church would say to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was in truth a charming hat, though only suited to
a lovely face. It became May exceedingly, and she had
been conscious of this when she had started in the
morning with her brothers; conscious perhaps of it
when she saw John Temple&rsquo;s gray eyes looking upward
to the gallery, for she loved to think that she should
seem fair in his sight, and now to hear it descried!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is a very pretty hat,&rdquo; she answered, somewhat
indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To go on the stage with, perhaps, but not for a
respectable farmer&rsquo;s daughter to appear at church in,&rdquo;
continued Mrs. Churchill.</p>

<p>May slightly tossed her pretty head, and walked
indignantly out of the room. She had no idea of leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
off wearing her new hat, which had just cost her
two pounds, on account of her stepmother&rsquo;s remarks.
And immediately the early dinner was over she called
to her two young brothers to go out for a walk with
her, and wore the picture hat in spite of Mrs. Churchill.</p>

<p>During their afternoon ramble they went along the
country lane where May Churchill had first met John
Temple in the summer time, when she was gathering
wild roses to make a wreath to place on poor young
Phil Temple&rsquo;s grave. It was autumn now, and the
cobwebs on the grass and the chill in the breeze told
of the shortening days. The wild roses were gone, and
the meadow-sweet scented the air no longer, but there
was a serene and sober beauty in the changing leaves,
in the creeping brambles growing amid the hedge-rows.
And quite suddenly the three young people encountered
John Temple in this very lane. John had been thinking,
also, of that first meeting when he had sat on the
stile, and thought, smilingly, that this rural scene only
wanted &ldquo;a pretty milkmaid&rdquo; to complete the picture.
He remembered May as he had seen her thus, so fresh,
so fair, in her white frock and her dainty basket of
roses. And now with glad surprise he once more
encountered her.</p>

<p>They smiled and clasped each other&rsquo;s hands, but said
very few words, and then John looked at the two boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So these two young gentlemen are your brothers, I
suppose?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered May, while Willie and Hal grinned
responsively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad to have met you,&rdquo; continued John,
looking extremely happy to have done so, &ldquo;as I was
just going to post&mdash;&rdquo; and then he paused and looked
again at the boys.</p>

<p>Upon this Hal, who was the youngest, though the
sharpest of the two, administered a sharp kick at his
brother&rsquo;s ankle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Will,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I saw some awful jolly blackberries
at the other side of the hedge; let&rsquo;s go in for
some?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Will took the hint, and the two boys ran together to
the stile, so as to get to the other side of the hedge, and
John Temple and May were alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was on my way to post a letter to you, May,&rdquo; John
said; &ldquo;now I will give it to you&mdash;here it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew out his letter, and put it into May&rsquo;s hand as
he spoke, but he still held her hand fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to ask you to meet me, May,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To
meet me, and tell me what your answer to my last
letter is to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May&rsquo;s face flushed, and her breath came sharp; she
remembered John&rsquo;s last letter only too well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can not talk of it to-day,&rdquo; continued John; &ldquo;we
must be alone. In my letter to you to-day I asked you
to fix some time and name place, on Tuesday, as I
thought you would only get my letter to-morrow morning.
But now as you, have got it to-day, can we meet
to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; half-whispered May; John was still holding
her hand, still looking in her face, and May&rsquo;s heart was
beating very fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard something about you to-day, May,&rdquo;
presently said John; &ldquo;something that made me very
angry&mdash;only I did not believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what have you heard?&rdquo; asked May, raising her
beautiful eyes to his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you are flirting&mdash;yes, that was the horrid
word&mdash;flirting with that brute, young Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May&rsquo;s fair face flushed angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a dreadful untruth!&rdquo; she cried, indignantly;
&ldquo;I have been so miserable about this; that woman my
father has married has taken it into her head that I
should marry this dreadful man, and she asks him to
the house, and the other day sent him into the garden
after me, and he asked me to marry him, and I told
him I never should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said John Temple, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I detest him, and can not bear to be in the room with
him,&rdquo; went on May; &ldquo;and Mrs. Churchill has been so
rude to me about it, and makes my home and my life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
quite miserable. My father seems to believe everything
she says, and when I got angry and said she was no
mother of mine, he took her part, and said if I did not
choose to treat her with proper respect, that I should not
remain in his house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did you say?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Very well, father; I will go.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brave little girl! And do you mean to say that your
father&mdash;actually your father!&mdash;could contemplate giving
you to that brute Henderson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, his wife can persuade him to do anything, and
she has persuaded him that Mr. Henderson would be a
very good match for me. It&rsquo;s too disgusting,&rdquo; continued
May, her fair face flushing and her eyes sparkling, &ldquo;and
I told them both that my own mother would never have
allowed such a person to come near me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall never come near you, my dear child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he threatened&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t go near him or speak
to him, Mr. Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he threaten me?&rdquo; asked John, disdainfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said some folly or other&mdash;he is horrid. He looks
like a murderer, if he isn&rsquo;t one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a very great idea that he is one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events he behaved shamefully to that poor
girl, and yet my father&rsquo;s wife praises him, and makes up
to him in every way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us forget that charming lady for awhile. What
time can you meet me to-morrow, May, and where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard my father&rsquo;s wife say she was going somewhere
to-morrow afternoon with my father, so I can
come any time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here at three o&rsquo;clock, then, my dear little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple spoke very tenderly, and felt very tenderly
to the fair young girl by his side. He took both
her hands in his; he smilingly admired the offending
hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So this is the new picture hat, is it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By
Mrs. Layton&rsquo;s account, May, you are going straight on
the road to perdition for wearing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And my father&rsquo;s wife found fault with it, too,&rdquo;
answered May, smiling. &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it charming; only the face beneath it is so
much more charming that I can not admire it long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you are flattering me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment Hal Churchill&rsquo;s rosy face appeared
above from the other side of the hedge, and though it
did not remain long, his observations induced him to
remark to his brother Willie:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Willie, I believe those two are spoons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo; asked Will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s holding her hands, and going on, anyhow.
Blessed good thing it would be if they are, as then May
would marry the young squire, and we would get no
end of tips, and get out of the way sometimes for a bit
of that awful woman at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s disgusting,&rdquo; answered Will, emphatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beastly,&rdquo; said the younger brother, equally emphatically;
and then the two boys re-crossed the stile, and May
and John Temple seeing this, advanced to meet them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got lots of blackberries?&rdquo; asked John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Barely ripe,&rdquo; replied Hal, amiably, to his proposed
brother-in-law. &ldquo;Have a few?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened his stained cotton pocket handkerchief as
he spoke, and offered the luxuries it contained to John,
who, however, shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am too old to eat blackberries,&rdquo; he said, with a
smile; &ldquo;I wish I were not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not do you any harm,&rdquo; hospitably pressed Hal;
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s a good &rsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again John shook his head, with a little laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was a boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I adored blackberries
and tips,&rdquo; and he put his hand into his pocket and drew
out two golden coins.</p>

<p>Hal grinned from ear to ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buy what you like with it,&rdquo; continued John, pressing
a sovereign into Hal&rsquo;s somewhat dirty little hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, sir,&rdquo; answered Hal, delightedly, but
when John presented the other sovereign to Will
Churchill, the elder boy drew back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, sir,&rdquo; he said, and colored deeply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not take a tip!&rdquo; laughed John. &ldquo;Oh, nonsense; come,
take it, my lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Will hesitated and looked at May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him to take it,&rdquo; said John, also looking at May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Mr. Temple is so kind, Will, I think you ought
to accept his present,&rdquo; answered May, with a little
laugh, and then Will, as though half-unwillingly, took
the golden coin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will walk to the end of the lane with you, and then
say good-by,&rdquo; said John, next moment, and so the boys
fell behind, and John had time to half-whisper to May
as they walked on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not forget; to-morrow, here, at three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this they parted, and the three young Churchills
returned together to Woodside Farm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a nice chap,&rdquo; remarked Hal, patronizingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered May, with embarrassment; &ldquo;but,
boys, don&rsquo;t mention at home that we met him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hal winked his blue eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mum&rsquo;s the word,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, May,
he&rsquo;s a deal better fellow, I am sure, than that surly
brute, Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May gave no opinion as to the comparative merits of
her two admirers. She walked home feeling intensely
happy. All her troubles seemed to have melted into
air. John Temple loved her; she was to see him
to-morrow, and for the present she needed no more
than this.</p>

<p>Both at tea and supper Mrs. Churchill noticed the
lovely bloom on her stepdaughter&rsquo;s smooth cheeks,
and the glad, bright look in her eyes. She was an
observant woman, this, and took an opportunity of
inquiring of Hal Churchill during the evening if they
had met anyone they knew when they were out
walking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a soul,&rdquo; answered Master Hal; &ldquo;we met two
pigs, that was all the company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How absurd you are, boy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Churchill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
crossly. She had not been used to children, and their
ways worried her. But Hal, with his sovereign in his
pocket, and May, with her love in her heart, were both
too happy to care about Mrs. Churchill. They were
each thinking of their treasures, and all their stepmother&rsquo;s
shafts fell harmless.</p>

<p>May was up betimes the next morning; up to watch
the rosy clouds in the west heralding in the day, and
the sun rise over the green meadows and the yellow
fields of ripening corn. It was a beautiful morning,
but would it keep fine, May asked herself anxiously
again and again, as she stood there gazing out on the
misty blue sky. If it rained it might prevent her stepmother
starting on her expedition; it might prevent
her own meeting with John Temple.</p>

<p>But up rose the sun in cloudless splendor, and presently
its rays fell on May&rsquo;s bright head; on her sweet,
up-turned face, and bare white throat. They fell on no
fairer picture in all that bright autumn day! It was
something beyond mere earthly beauty that radiated
the girl&rsquo;s face as she stood watching the rising sun. All
that was best and noblest within her was stirred, as it
were, with a deep wave of strong and unchanging love.</p>

<p>How the rest of that morning passed she scarcely
knew. Mrs. Churchill fussed and scolded, but it all fell
on deaf ears. May was living in a world of her own,
and Mrs. Churchill&rsquo;s sharp voice could not reach it.
Then came the early dinner, and after this was over
her father and her stepmother drove away. They were
going to Castle Hill, Mrs. Churchill&rsquo;s own place, and as
it was some distance from Woodside, May knew it must
be nightfall before their return.</p>

<p>She breathed a soft sigh of relief as she saw them
disappear. Then she went up to her own room and
moved about restlessly until it was time for her to go to
keep her tryst with John Temple. She saw the two
lads leave the house also from her window, and so she
felt absolutely free.</p>

<p>At half-past two o&rsquo;clock she started. She walked
quickly&mdash;perhaps unconsciously&mdash;yet when she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
reached the place of meeting John was already there.
He was not sitting on the stile this time, as he had
done when they first had met in this country lane. He
was walking to and fro, with a bent head and a somewhat
anxious brow; but his face brightened when he
saw May. He advanced quickly to meet her; he took
both her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was half afraid you might not be able to come,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father and his wife have gone out for the day,&rdquo;
answered May, &ldquo;and the boys also are out. I have a
whole afternoon to myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; asked John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, all for you,&rdquo; smiled May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sweetheart!&rdquo; said John, and he bent down and
kissed her. &ldquo;Now, will you give me your answer&mdash;the
answer I asked in my letter&mdash;is yours the love that
can not change?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not speak; she looked at him for a moment,
and then nestled her sweet face against his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, my dear one,&rdquo; urged John; &ldquo;will there be
no change in your love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again May looked up, and this time her rosy lips
parted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mine is a love that can not change, John,&rdquo; she murmured
below her breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it so, then,&rdquo; said John Temple, almost solemnly,
and he looked up to the blue sky as he spoke, and made
an inward vow. &ldquo;Neither will my love change,&rdquo; he
said aloud the next moment; &ldquo;for weal or woe then,
May, our future will be together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did not speak for a short while after this. John
drew May closer to his breast, and she leaned there at
rest and happy. A great content seemed to overflow
her being. She was with John. John had just said
they should never part.</p>

<p>Presently John broke the sweet silence that seemed
like heaven to the girl&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will not be all smooth sailing, you know, May,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; continued John Temple, with a sort of
effort, &ldquo;that our marriage, for a time at least, will have
to be a secret one. There are several reasons for this;
one is that my uncle would oppose it, and the other
that Mrs. Temple has taken a very absurd prejudice
against your family on account of the death of her
boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; asked May, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems that one or both of your brothers played
in the game of football when poor young Phil Temple
was killed, and his mother foolishly&mdash;for she is a foolish
woman&mdash;has taken it into her head that one of your
brothers gave him the fatal blow on the head. She has
had a dream, or some nonsense or other, and she
assured me gravely last night that she heard her boy&rsquo;s
voice say distinctly twice in one night, &lsquo;One of the
Churchills killed me.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s fancy, no doubt,&rdquo; continued
John Temple, as he saw May&rsquo;s rosy bloom beginning to
fade; &ldquo;but you see it makes things for us more difficult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; said May, slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In fact, my dear one, there is nothing for it but a
secret marriage,&rdquo; went on John, decidedly. &ldquo;I have
thought it all over&mdash;what would be best for us both&mdash;that
is if you truly love me, May?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, I do!&rdquo; answered May, with such emotion that
her eyes grew misty with unshed tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will tell you my plans. They are that you
should leave here at once; go up to town alone. Do
not be frightened; a home will be ready for you with
two very respectable old ladies, who keep a lodging-house,
or rather did, in Bayswater. I lodged with them
once when I was much younger, and I was such a
favorite of theirs we have always kept up a kind of
acquaintance. They have retired from the lodging-house
business, but I will write and ask them to receive
my young cousin, Miss Churchill, for a short time, and
I know they will gladly do so. In a fortnight I will
join you, and we will be married from their house, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
all the good people here will be none the wiser. Will
you consent to this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do whatever you wish me,&rdquo; said May, trustfully,
and she put her hand in his.</p>

<p>A slight change passed over John&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not happy at home, May, are you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am most unhappy. Mrs. Churchill makes me
miserable about that wretched Mr. Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all right then; when can you start for town&mdash;to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; repeated May, startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the sooner the better, for then the sooner I can
join you. I will write to the Miss Websters at once,
and give you their address&mdash;and May, I have brought
fifty pounds with me for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I can not take that,&rdquo; answered May, with a
sudden blush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear one, you must! You are my little cousin,
you know, until you are my wife, and my little cousin
must pay her way. Here it is, May, and do not be
foolish. Now what train will you start by to-morrow?
I can not, I am afraid, see you off on account of the
confounded gossip it would cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you must not do that. I will go in what
train I can get quickly away by&mdash;and you will join me,
John?&rdquo; she added, wistfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; said John Temple, earnestly, &ldquo;and I
will write to you. But be cautious, dear May, for both
our sakes. This is the Websters&rsquo; address. Drive
straight from the station to their house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and John, oh, John!&mdash;you do not repent
liking me&mdash;you do care for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care for you with all my heart and soul, May! I
love you as deeply as a man can love a woman; do not,
at least, doubt my love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and kissed her again and
again, and with tenderest words of affection at length
they parted; May returning at once to Woodside to
make her preparations for leaving it, and John Temple
going back to the Hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>On her road home May determined what to do. She
would take her young brother Hal partly into her confidence,
and tell him she was about to run away from
home on account of her stepmother&rsquo;s treatment. But
when she arrived at the farm she found that a letter
from her father awaited her, which had been sent by
hand. This letter informed her that on account of the
length of the drive to and from Castle Hill, that he
and his wife had determined to remain there all night,
but would return on the following afternoon or evening.</p>

<p>This made everything much easier for May. She
said nothing to Hal that night, but packed up her
small belongings ready for an early start in the morning.
Then when the boys had gone to bed she went to
her own room, and stood there looking wistfully around.
She had slept here in her childhood; she had slept here
in her blooming young maidenhood, and she knew that
after the night was past she would sleep here no more.
She was going to take a leap in the dark; a leap into
the unknown, but there was no fear in her heart, for
&ldquo;perfect love casteth out fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knelt down before she went to bed, and prayed
for John Temple; prayed that there should be no
change in their love in all their future lives.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>DISAPPEARED.</small></h2>


<p>Mr. and Mrs. Churchill returned to Woodside late
on the following evening, and were both somewhat
surprised not to find May up to receive them. The
two boys, however, were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May has gone to bed with a bad headache,&rdquo; said
Hal, with a grin, for the information of his stepmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she should have sat up; it is only proper
respect to us,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Churchill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if she is ill, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Churchill, who
somehow missed seeing his pretty daughter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Churchill said nothing more on the subject.
She ate her supper and arranged &ldquo;the things&rdquo; that
she had brought from Castle Hill to her own satisfaction,
and then retired for the night, well satisfied
with herself and what she had done during the day.</p>

<p>And the next morning she rose early, as was her
usual practice, and began her healthful daily life with
her accustomed energy. At half-past eight o&rsquo;clock she
and her husband and the two boys were seated at the
well-spread breakfast table, but still May had not
appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ring the breakfast bell again, Hal,&rdquo; directed Mrs.
Churchill presently. &ldquo;I can not have May lying in bed
all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The breakfast bell was rung for the second time, but
it failed to bring May down-stairs. Therefore, after she
had finished her own excellent breakfast with excellent
appetite, Mrs. Churchill said she would go upstairs to
see after her stepdaughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not take her up any tea, as she may be only
idling,&rdquo; she remarked, as she rose from the table; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ll see what is really the matter with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She accordingly went upstairs and rapped at May&rsquo;s
bedroom door. There was no reply, so Mrs. Churchill
opened it and went in.</p>

<p>One glance at the bed showed her that it had not
been slept in; another glance around the room told her
it was empty.</p>

<p>Mrs. Churchill felt half-frightened. Again she looked
around, and this time her eyes fell on a letter lying on
the toilet-table. She approached the toilet-table and
took up the letter. It was directed to her husband, and
it was sealed, and Mrs. Churchill knew at once that
something very serious had happened.</p>

<p>She hurried out of the room carrying the letter with
her. As she descended the staircase she saw her husband
in the hall, about to open the front door, for the
purpose of leaving the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;William!&rdquo; she called, and waved the letter, and
when Mr. Churchill noticed the expression of her face
he at once turned back to meet her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; she said, opening the dining-room
door, and putting her hand on her husband&rsquo;s arm as
she spoke. The dining-room was empty and Mrs.
Churchill closed the door behind them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; she said, when they were alone, &ldquo;May is
not in her room; the bed has never been slept in, and
she has left this letter lying on the toilet-table for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! What can be the matter?&rdquo; exclaimed
Mr. Churchill; and he proceeded to tear open the
letter, and read it eagerly, while his wife peered over
his shoulder trying to do so too.</p>

<p>And this was what he read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear Father</span>: You told me once that you did
not wish me to remain in your house if I could not
treat your wife with the respect which you considered
was her due. I find I can not do this; nor can I endure
any longer the, to me, odious visits of Mr. Henderson.
I am, therefore, going away, and you need not be afraid
for my future life. I should not have left you if I did
not know that you had someone to look after you and
care for you, but this I am sure you have. Be kind to
the two dear boys, and believe me to remain still, your
affectionate daughter.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">May.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s clear bronzed complexion flushed
darkly as he read this letter and comprehended its
meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; he asked, handing it
to his wife.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Churchill read the letter fully, and her
clear skin also flushed as she did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has run away with someone,&rdquo; she said, as she
finished the letter. &ldquo;She tried to put the blame on
me, but that is an excuse&mdash;she has gone with some
lover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has no lover that I know of but young Henderson,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Churchill, somewhat hoarsely. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
was terribly upset by May&rsquo;s letter, remembering the
words which he himself had used to his young daughter,
and to which she had referred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was sure to have lovers,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
Churchill. &ldquo;You may not know of them. Who can
tell? It may be someone beneath her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know May when you say that!&rdquo; said Mr.
Churchill, angrily. &ldquo;May is a thorough little lady whatever
she is. She would not look at anyone beneath her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet such things have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May would do nothing of the sort; I know that,&rdquo;
positively asserted her father. &ldquo;And how do we know
that she has gone away with anyone? Most likely gone
on some wild-goose chase because she could not get on
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! try to blame me. That&rsquo;s just like a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not blaming you; but I won&rsquo;t have anything
of that kind said of my girl. May held herself too high
for that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Churchill did not speak. She drew in her firm
lips. She bore a fresh grudge against May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are the boys? The boys may know something
about this?&rdquo; now said Mr. Churchill.</p>

<p>The boys were accordingly called into the dining-room.
Will went innocently, but Hal with a guilty conscience,
which, however, he was prepared to disguise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you last see your sister yesterday?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Churchill, sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had tea with her at five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; answered Will;
&ldquo;and after that I did not see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Hal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw her a bit later, and she was going out for a
walk then,&rdquo; replied the boy; &ldquo;and she said she had a
headache and would go to bed directly she came in, and
would not sit up for you&mdash;and that I was to tell you so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you did not see her again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I went out, and when I came back I supposed
May had gone to bed as she said she would, for I saw
nothing more of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she said nothing to you about going away?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; untruthfully affirmed Hal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet she is not in the house; she has written to say
she has gone away,&rdquo; said Mr. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone away?&rdquo; repeated Will, in great surprise.
&ldquo;Where has she gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does not say where,&rdquo; answered his father. &ldquo;This
must be seen to at once. Sarah, go and ask the servants
if they know anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Churchill obeyed her husband, but the servants
knew nothing. &ldquo;Miss,&rdquo; the housemaid said, had told
her she had a headache, and would not sit up to supper.
She had not seen her go out, and &ldquo;miss&rdquo; had requested
her not to go into her room, as she hoped to go to sleep
and did not wish to be disturbed.</p>

<p>This was all Mrs. Churchill learned in the kitchen,
but when she again went up to May&rsquo;s bedroom she
found that a small leather trunk, that belonged to her,
and nearly all her best clothes, had also disappeared.
Her flight, therefore, had been clearly premeditated.
Someone also must have assisted her, as it was almost
impossible that she could have carried away her trunk
herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Churchill went down and told her husband all
this, and he once more questioned the boys, but both
denied they knew anything about it; Willie truthfully,
Hal untruthfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my word for it, she has run away with someone,&rdquo;
repeated Mrs. Churchill.</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill now began to think there must be some
truth in this. It could not be young Henderson, as she
disliked him so much; and then there was Mr. Goodall,
the curate&mdash;but no, May always laughed at him&mdash;and
then suddenly Mr. Churchill remembered John Temple,
and seeing May and him in the garden together in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>He gave a sort of exclamation as the idea struck him,
but he said nothing. Mr. John Temple was his landlord&rsquo;s
nephew and heir, and it was a very serious thing
to bring any such accusation against him unless he had
good grounds for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will drive over to the station, and see if I can hear
anything there,&rdquo; he said, hastily, and he accordingly did
this, and was received in a friendly manner by the
station-master, with whom he was well acquainted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a word with you, Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; said Mr.
Churchill, in some agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir. Come in here,&rdquo; replied the station-master,
leading Mr. Churchill into his private office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything of my daughter, yesterday?&rdquo;
now asked Mr. Churchill, in an anxious voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir, of course; I put her into the quarter-to-six
train myself, on her road to London. She told
me she was going to pay a visit there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To London?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Churchill; and he turned
so pale that the station-master grew alarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing wrong, I hope, sir?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mr. Churchill, with a sort of gasp.
&ldquo;The truth is, Johnson&mdash;don&rsquo;t mention this&mdash;but I&rsquo;m
afraid my daughter and my new wife did not get on
over-well, and I think the foolish girl must have run
away from home. Was she alone when she came to the
station?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite alone, sir,&rdquo; answered the station-master. &ldquo;In
the afternoon a boy brought a trunk and said it had to
wait for a young lady who was coming to catch a train.
And I just happened to look at the address, and it was
&lsquo;Miss Churchill, London.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that was all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was all, sir&mdash;&lsquo;Miss Churchill, London.&rsquo; I wondered
at the time there was nothing more, but there
was not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the boy who brought the trunk; it was not one
of my boys, was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no, sir! I know both your boys quite
well. This was a common sort of lad in a fustian
jacket, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d know him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she came to the train? How did she look?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She came into the station quite cheerful, sir, and
she took a second-class fare to London, and I put her
into the carriage myself. I asked her if she was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
for a long visit, as you see I&rsquo;ve known her ever since
she was a child, and she smiled in her pretty way.
&rsquo;Yes, Mr. Johnson,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;a long visit;&rsquo; and those
were her last words to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill groaned aloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear she has run away,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and as well
seek for a needle in a bundle of hay as find anyone in
London if they went to hide. Thank you, Johnson.
Don&rsquo;t say anything, but I fear it&rsquo;s a bad business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Mr. Churchill left the station with a heavy heart,
but on the way home he saw the gray walls and towers
of Woodlea Hall standing amid the trees in the distance,
and again the thought of John Temple recurred to his
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make some excuse and go and see if he&rsquo;s there,
at any rate,&rdquo; he decided, and accordingly he turned
his horse&rsquo;s head down the avenue that led to the Hall,
and a few minutes later drew up at the back entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I see the squire?&rdquo; he asked in some agitation.</p>

<p>It was yet early morning, and the squire was still at
breakfast. But Mr. Churchill was known to be a favorite
tenant, and one of the servants took up a message
that he was waiting until the squire could see him. A
message came back, would Mr. Churchill go into the
library, and Mr. Temple would join him immediately.</p>

<p>This the squire did, and in his quiet, courteous manner
held out his hand to Mr. Churchill, who took it
nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am in sad trouble, sir,&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am extremely sorry to hear this, Mr. Churchill,&rdquo;
answered the squire, with real interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about my daughter, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, that pretty girl?&rdquo; interrupted the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, May&mdash;well, sir, the truth is that May and my
new wife didn&rsquo;t get on over-well together, and we&mdash;my
wife and I&mdash;have been away from home for a couple
of days, and when we went to seek May this morning
we found she was not in the house. Then I went to
the station&mdash;I have just been there&mdash;and Johnson,
the station-master, he says May left last evening by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the quarter-to-six train for London, and that&rsquo;s every
word we know about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she left no letter? Told no one she was going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she left a letter for me, to say she was going,
and that was all; not a word where she was going to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is very distressing. Did she say nothing to
her brothers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word&mdash;and squire, there is something I
wanted to ask you&mdash;&rdquo; and then Mr. Churchill hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray ask me, Mr. Churchill, and if there is anything
I can do for you, you may depend on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, you see May and your nephew, Mr. John
Temple, were a good bit together about that unfortunate
girl&rsquo;s death at Fern Dene, and I&rsquo;ve been wondering
if he could tell us anything? No offense, you know,
squire, only sometimes girls tell their troubles or fancied
troubles to other young people, and I thought perhaps
she might have said something to Mr. John Temple&mdash;that
is, if he is at the Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is certainly at the Hall,&rdquo; replied the squire,
gravely. &ldquo;He returned last Saturday, and is now in
the breakfast-room. Would you like to see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I might make so bold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Temple rose and rang the bell, and when the
footman answered it he said quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask Mr. John Temple kindly to come to the library
for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The footman bowed and disappeared, and a few
moments of uncomfortable silence passed between the
squire and his tenant. The squire was remembering
his advice to John on the subject of May Churchill;
her father seeing the two together in the moonlit
garden.</p>

<p>Then John Temple appeared, calm, assured, and a
little pale.</p>

<p>He shook hands with Mr. Churchill, and then looked
at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said the squire, as the farmer hesitated,
&ldquo;Mr. Churchill has called here about his daughter; it
seems that the young lady disappeared from her home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
yesterday in the absence of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,
and as you were a good deal thrown with her about
that unfortunate affair at Fern Dene, Mr. Churchill
wishes to know if she ever gave you any hint regarding
her intention of leaving her home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. John, that&rsquo;s just it; just as the squire
says,&rdquo; put in Mr. Churchill, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied John Temple, calmly. &ldquo;I
was, as you say, a good deal thrown with Miss Churchill
regarding that unfortunate affair, but she never mentioned
anything whatever to me about leaving her
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she made no complaints?&rdquo; asked Mr. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None. I think she once said she disliked that young
Henderson very much; that was at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when did you last see her, Mr. John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been away, but I saw her last Sunday at
church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a bold speech, yet John Temple never
faltered as he spoke it. He had made up his mind that
these inquiries were sure to be made, and he risked the
chance that no one had seen his interviews with May
on Sunday or Monday.</p>

<p>At all events he convinced both his uncle and Mr.
Churchill that he had nothing to do with May&rsquo;s disappearance.
The farmer thanked him and the squire,
and then withdrew, and John and his uncle were left
alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange business,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;but I suppose
it is the fault of the new wife. This pretty girl
has perhaps gone to try her fortune in London, in
preference to living at home in uncongenial company.
But it&rsquo;s a pity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Someone told me, I forget who,&rdquo; answered John,
&ldquo;that the new wife, as you call her, was bent on marrying
this pretty girl to that brute young Henderson. In
that case one can not wonder at her running away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope she&rsquo;ll come to no trouble; she&rsquo;s a very
pretty girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; replied John, laconically, and then he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
away; but his uncle noticed that during the rest of the
day there was a cloud upon his brow.</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill, in the meanwhile, had returned home,
and had told his news to his wife. May had gone to
London alone, and the station-master had seen her off,
and a strange boy had taken her trunk to the station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it has been all planned beforehand!&rdquo;
exclaimed Mrs. Churchill. &ldquo;How deceitful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill said nothing, and was certainly looking
anything but happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you put it into the hands of the police?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the farmer, decidedly. &ldquo;May would
have some little money with her&mdash;a matter of twenty
pounds or so, at least, and she can&rsquo;t starve for a week
or two with that. And when she wants money she can
come home. Remember that, Sarah,&rdquo; he added,
emphatically, &ldquo;whenever my girl wants to come back,
she&rsquo;s welcome here.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>AT PEMBRIDGE TERRACE.</small></h2>


<p>While these inquiries about her flight were going on,
May Churchill was safely sheltered in the home John
Temple had provided for her in town. This she found
to be an extremely comfortable one, and the two ladies
of the establishment the most amiable of women.</p>

<p>May had arrived at King&rsquo;s Cross terminus nervous,
yet determined. She had left a home where she was
no longer happy, and she was going to be married to
the man she loved. What matter was it, she told herself,
that for the present this marriage had to be a
secret one? She had a perfect trust in John Temple,
and she knew he would never deceive her.</p>

<p>She easily got her small belongings collected, and
then directed the cab driver to convey her to the address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
in Bayswater that John Temple had given her. She
found herself there before she expected, and after the
cabman had rung the doorbell it was quickly opened,
and no less than four people appeared to welcome her.
A servant first; behind, two middle-aged ladies; and
behind the middle-aged ladies, a tall young man.</p>

<p>This young man, however, hurried to the front,
opened the cab door, and said, in a pleasant voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Churchill, I presume? My aunts are expecting
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; gasped May, nervously. &ldquo;Is this Miss Webster&rsquo;s
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, it is!&rdquo; screamed one of the middle-aged
ladies from the top of the door-steps. &ldquo;This is
our house, mine and sister Eliza&rsquo;s, and we expect you
are Mr. Temple&rsquo;s cousin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; faltered May.</p>

<p>By this time the young man had handed May out,
and she was standing on the flags, purse in hand, ready
to pay the cabman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the cabman!&rdquo; again screamed the lady
from the door-steps. &ldquo;Nephew Ralph will pay him,
and get in your luggage. Come in, my dear, and welcome;
any friend of Mr. Temple&rsquo;s is most welcome
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May accordingly ascended the door-steps, and her
hand was shaken most warmly, first by Miss Webster,
and then by Miss Eliza. They were thin, elderly
women, with pleasant faces, and were evidently pleased
to see their young guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be tired with your long journey, and
hungry, too,&rdquo; continued Miss Webster. &ldquo;We have a
little bit of hot supper ready for you. Jane,&rdquo; this was
to the servant, &ldquo;tell cook to dish up the partridges, and
mind she has the plates hot. Come in, my dear&mdash;this
is the dining-room&mdash;or would you rather go upstairs
and take off your hat first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>May accepted the last offer, and was accordingly
ushered into a most comfortable bedroom, where everything
was ready for her occupation. After pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
out the hot water, and telling her to be sure to ring for
what she wanted, Miss Webster then withdrew. Upon
this May bathed her face, and let down her long hair,
and in a few minutes appeared down-stairs, looking
so fresh and bright no one would have supposed that
she had just had a long journey.</p>

<p>The tall young man was standing on the hearth-rug
as she entered the dining-room, for a cheerful fire was
burning in the grate, and he bowed when May appeared,
and offered her a chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is our nephew, Mr. Ralph Webster,&rdquo; said Miss
Eliza, for Miss Webster happened to be out of the
room, looking after the supper. &ldquo;Miss Churchill, Mr.
Webster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Eliza having accomplished this introduction to
her satisfaction, sighed softly, and looked first at May&rsquo;s
blooming face and then at her nephew&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a handsome couple!&rdquo; she was thinking, and
again she sighed. By some mischance, Miss Eliza&rsquo;s
proper destiny had never been fulfilled. She ought to
have been one of the couple, and her whole nature
pointed in that direction. She was sentimental, tender-hearted,
and affectionate, and yet in her middle-age she
was still unwedded. But she had no jealousy of
younger women. On the contrary, the suppressed
maternal instincts in her heart seemed to bloom forth
when she beheld a fair young face. She also regarded
her tall nephew with something like the affection of a
mother.</p>

<p>But though he might be so in her eyes, Mr. Ralph
Webster could not justly be called &ldquo;handsome.&rdquo; He
had, however, an intelligent, clever face, with marked
features and dark gray penetrating eyes. His manner
was self-reliant and quick. Altogether a keen-looking
man, with a face well-suited to his profession, for he
was a barrister; a hard-working barrister, who had
already accomplished a fair amount of success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have had a long journey?&rdquo; he said, leaning
on the back of a chair and addressing May Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, rather,&rdquo; answered May, moving uneasily, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
she did not know what John Temple had said to the
Websters about her home, and Ralph Webster noticed
this slight uneasiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The country must be looking beautiful just now,&rdquo;
he continued, with his keen eyes fixed on her changing
face; &ldquo;this is the season of holidays, and I am longing
for mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like the autumn, too,&rdquo; said May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think I like the spring best,&rdquo; mildly remarked
Miss Eliza; &ldquo;in the autumn one feels that the winter is
so near; you should like the spring best, too, my dear,&rdquo;
she added, looking at May; &ldquo;you, who are in your
spring-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear sentimental Aunt Eliza!&rdquo; laughed Mr. Webster.
&ldquo;I am sure you are thinking of the lambkins
skipping about the green fields, while I am thinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare hardly say&mdash;lamb in another form, I am
afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ralph,&rdquo; gently rebuked Miss Eliza.</p>

<p>But here the conversation was interrupted by the
entrance of the supper and Miss Webster. Miss Webster
was the managing lady of the house, and though
only two years older than Miss Eliza, regarded her as
greatly her junior. She was more energetic and practical
than the younger sister, but their affection for
each other was very strong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are hungry, my dear,&rdquo; said Miss Webster,
now addressing May. &ldquo;Ralph, will you set a chair for
Miss Churchill, and carve the partridges?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph did both. He carved well, for he nearly did
everything well that he tried, and he had the good
sense if he did not do a thing well soon to leave off trying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One should never go on failing,&rdquo; he used to say, &ldquo;or
you get into the way of it. If one thing doesn&rsquo;t succeed,
another may; there should be successful careers for us
all&mdash;even for crossing-sweepers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He, in fact, had made up his mind to succeed in life,
and he knew the way was to work hard. He spent his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
evenings as a rule in reading dry books, instead of
amusing himself like many of his compeers. He was
equipping himself for the legal battles he meant to
fight, and was determined to have his armor ready
when it came his turn to put it on. And he knew
his turn would come. A man like this has sometimes
to wait for his chance, but as a rule he does not wait
long. Sagacious eyes mark the rising juniors, and are
glad to push them on. Ralph Webster was already by
no means an unknown man in legal circles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will rise, and rise high,&rdquo; a good judge of human
nature had predicted of him, and certainly he was doing
his best to fulfill this prophecy.</p>

<p>His good aunts were not a little proud of him, and he
was in a way fond of these two simple, kindly women.
They were the only relatives he had in town, and he
sometimes used to stay with them, though as a rule he
lived in the Temple. He was staying with them now,
and to his great amusement had been told of the
expected arrival of Mr. John Temple&rsquo;s &ldquo;country cousin&rdquo;
before May Churchill came. Now, when she had arrived,
he sat looking at her with admiration and curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the prettiest girl I ever saw,&rdquo; he said to his
aunts, after he had lit his pipe, and May had retired for
the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sweet face certainly,&rdquo; sighed Miss Eliza.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than a sweet face,&rdquo; answered Ralph Webster,
in his energetic way; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a beautiful face. What
did Temple say about her to you, Aunt Margaret, when
he wrote?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said she was his cousin, his young cousin, and
would we take her in, and be kind to her for a fortnight
or so, when he would come up to town to join
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky dog!&rdquo; laughed Ralph Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Miss Webster, with a sudden blush
spreading over her faded complexion, &ldquo;he inclosed a
check, a ridiculously large check, for her expenses, and
asked us to take her out a little to see the sights, as she
has never been in London before. It&rsquo;s a bad time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the year certainly for sights; but still perhaps you will
help us a little, Ralph, to amuse her till you go on your
holiday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a young woman who has never been in town
there are always plenty of &lsquo;sights,&rsquo; as you call them, to
be seen in London. Yes, Aunt Margaret, I shall be glad
to escort you and Aunt Eliza and the country cousin
anywhere you like during the next few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How good of you, Ralph!&rdquo; exclaimed Aunt Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So good!&rdquo; chimed Aunt Eliza.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good to myself, I should suggest,&rdquo; said Ralph Webster.
And then after one or two vigorous puffs at his
pipe he drew it out of his lips for a moment or two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the by,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how was it you got to know
this Mr. Temple? I forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; answered Aunt Margaret, with
another sudden blush spreading over her faded skin,
which was also reflected on Aunt Eliza&rsquo;s gentle face,
&ldquo;it was at the time&mdash;well, when our dear father was
taken from us, and of course the pecuniary advantages
of his living expired with him. We were thus left very
badly off, and had our dear mother to consider. Therefore,
when Mrs. Mason, our dear mother&rsquo;s only sister,
heard of our position she proposed that we should take
a house in town, and bring the furniture up, and&mdash;well,
try to take in lodgers or boarders. It was, of
course, a great trial to my dear sister and myself, but
we felt it was our duty, and we did it, and Mr. Temple,
who was a much younger man then, stayed with us
three years, and we have regarded him with sincere
friendship ever since. He is quite a gentleman, in
word and deed, and it was a pleasure to have him with
us, though, considering poor Aunt Mason&rsquo;s ample
means, and that she had no family of her own, I almost
wonder she liked her nieces to receive strangers under
their roof; particularly when she meant to leave us
independent a few years afterward, which she did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So this was how you got to know Mr. Temple?&rdquo; said
Ralph Webster, after listening to Miss Margaret&rsquo;s long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
explanation. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a barrister, you say, but does not
practice? I must look up his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He never practiced; he was well off, but not rich,
and then some months ago he came into a great windfall.
A little boy, the heir of the head of the family,
Mr. Temple of Woodlea Hall, was accidentally killed at
football, and Mr. John Temple became the heir of the
property, and when he called the last time he was in
town he told us that some day, if he lived, he would be a
very rich man; but his good fortune did not seem to
elate him, did it, Eliza?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; replied Aunt Eliza, &ldquo;Mr. Temple is
quite above anything of that kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder where he picked up the country cousin?&rdquo;
said Ralph Webster, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most probably at his uncle&rsquo;s, the squire of Woodlea.
Where do you think we could take her to-morrow,
Ralph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until we see what to-morrow brings forth in
the way of weather,&rdquo; answered Ralph Webster, and
they settled it thus, and shortly afterward the two sisters
retired to rest, and their nephew was left to his
reflections.</p>

<p>The next morning was fine, and when Ralph Webster
saw May Churchill by daylight he decided she was
prettier than ever. She had rested well; she was fresh
and fair, and she carried on an animated conversation
with Ralph Webster during the whole of the breakfast
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you row, play tennis, and hunt, and have
all sorts of country occupations?&rdquo; asked Ralph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I play tennis, but I neither row nor hunt,&rdquo; answered
May, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! you are not one of those manly young ladies
who intend to annihilate us poor male creatures off
the face of the earth, or at least our occupations and
professions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite; but I think it a very good thing that
women nowadays can find occupations and professions
for themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair to men, it&rsquo;s really not,&rdquo; answered Webster,
smiling also. &ldquo;Just take my profession, for
instance, which I fully expect will be invaded by the
female element in no time. Now I ask you what
chance has a judge to be just, to say nothing of the
susceptible bosoms of the twelve good men in the jury
box, when confronted with a lovely creature in silk
pleading the cause of some ruffian? She&rsquo;d talk them
all over. She&rsquo;d paint the blackest crimes white, and it
would certainly come to this, that the handsomest
female barristers would get all the briefs, because it
would be only too well known that no man could resist
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought,&rdquo; said May, who was very much
amused, &ldquo;that before barristers wear silk that they are
not quite so young as they once were? Suppose, then,
an elderly female barrister, with her brow wrinkled
with thought, and her sallow cheeks lined with study,
were to confront the jury, do you think that she would
have any more effect than a man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You draw an appalling picture,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for my
part I can only answer I don&rsquo;t think she would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you see she would be earning her living; and
what can poor women do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They should marry, and men should work for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they can&rsquo;t all marry; hundreds of things may
prevent them marrying. I often wish I had been
brought up to a profession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please turn your eyes away from mine; I do not
wish to be cut out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, you are sure to marry,&rdquo; said Aunt Eliza,
mildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing is sure, Miss Webster,&rdquo; laughed May, but
she blushed so charmingly at the same time that Ralph
Webster felt a new strange sensation that he did not
quite understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day is lovely,&rdquo; he said, starting up from the
breakfast table and going to the window. &ldquo;Suppose
we all go down the river?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>The expedition was soon settled after this. The river
was all new to May, and its reedy, willowy shores, its
shining waters, and placid flow seemed delightful to
her as she sat side by side with Aunt Eliza, or dipped
her little hands into the cool stream.</p>

<p>Ralph Webster was a good oarsman, and presently he
insisted that May should try to learn to row, and began
instructing her. The girl was an apt pupil, and her
strong young frame was quite capable of the fatigue.
She enjoyed it, and when Aunt Eliza produced her
luncheon basket, and they rowed in to have lunch,
May declared she had never been so hungry before.
Altogether they had a very pleasant day, and returned
to Pembridge Terrace for dinner, where Aunt Margaret
awaited them with a substantial and well-cooked repast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day is not done,&rdquo; said Ralph Webster, when
dinner was over; &ldquo;let us go to one of the theaters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His aunts looked at him in mild surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; they said, almost together, with a slight
variation of words, &ldquo;Miss Churchill will be tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But May declared she was not tired, and her blooming
face betokened the truth of her words. So to one
of the theaters they went, though Aunt Eliza was tired
if May was not. And the next day they went somewhere
else, and Ralph Webster suddenly ceased to talk
about going on his holiday. But on the third day of
May&rsquo;s stay in Pembridge Terrace Miss Webster received
a letter which caused her to look a little grave.</p>

<p>It was from John Temple, and inclosed a letter for
May. And it struck Miss Webster&rsquo;s simple mind at
once to wonder why he should not write to his &ldquo;young
cousin,&rdquo; as he called her, direct. And something&mdash;she
knew not what&mdash;induced Miss Webster not to give
this letter to May in the presence of Ralph Webster.</p>

<p>Perhaps she felt that his keen eyes would see more
in it than there really was. At all events she put it
into May&rsquo;s hand when they were alone, and she noticed
the quick blush and the glad look with which the girl
received it.</p>

<p>May retired at once with her new letter to her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
room, and when she got there she read as follows in
John Temple&rsquo;s handwriting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear One&mdash;My Dear Little Sweetheart</span>: I
have been thinking of you so much to-day that I must
write. But I think it safer to send it under cover to
dear kind Miss Webster, as one never can tell what
spies there are about, and your disappearance from
home has naturally created a great sensation here.
The morning after you left your father came to Woodlea,
and asked to see my uncle, and then me. He questioned
me pretty sharply, and asked when I had last seen
you. I risked it, and said at church, and that you had
said nothing to me about leaving your father&rsquo;s house.
Then Mrs. Temple attacked me on the subject, and
finally yesterday I met that brute young Henderson,
and I wish you had seen the desperate look he gave me
as he passed me on the road. They say he drinks
heavily, and is altogether going to the bad, and that he
made a frightful scene when he heard you were gone.
So you see altogether we can not be too careful. I dare
not in fact leave here at present, or people&mdash;Henderson,
and Mrs. Temple I am certain&mdash;would suspect I
was going to join you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore, my dear one, we must wait a little while
yet before I can go to you. For the reasons I told you
of our marriage must be a secret one for the present,
though this is very hard both on you and me. But I
hope you are happy with Miss Webster, and I need not
tell you that the moment I can do so with safety that I
will join you, and then we can be married at once.
Brighter days are, I am sure, in store for us, my Mayflower,
but in the meantime when you write will you
give your letters to Miss Webster to inclose to me, as
it would not do for your letters to come here. Always
devotedly yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Temple</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>THE BIG LETTER.</small></h2>


<p>A vague sense of disappointment stole into May
Churchill&rsquo;s heart as she read this letter of John Temple&rsquo;s&mdash;a
vague sense of disappointment and pain. He
seemed so terribly afraid that people should talk about
them, and then, her father&mdash;for the first time May felt
remorse about her father&mdash;and began to realize that
she might have caused him great anxiety.</p>

<p>And her own position, too, unless they were to be
married soon, would be very trying. John had said that
in a fortnight at latest he would join her, but now he
did not seem at all certain of this. Altogether the letter
disturbed her exceedingly, and she was sitting still
and silent in her own room, when kind Miss Eliza
rapped at the door and put in her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;our nephew Ralph wishes to
know if you would like to go to one of the picture galleries
this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not, Miss Eliza,&rdquo; answered May in a constrained
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you feeling tired?&rdquo; now asked good Miss Eliza;
&ldquo;Ah, I was afraid you were doing too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I do feel a little tired, but it is nothing; only
I should rather not go out this morning,&rdquo; said May,
gently. &ldquo;But please thank Mr. Webster for his kindness
in offering to take me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure it gives him pleasure; but I&rsquo;ll go now and
tell him you do not wish to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this Miss Eliza went away, and presently May
heard the front door of the house shut sharply. It was
Ralph Webster going out, with also a feeling of disappointment
in his heart of which he was half-ashamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can have tired her, I wonder?&rdquo; he was reflecting.
&ldquo;She seemed as bright as possible last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May in the meanwhile was thinking of what she should
do about answering John Temple&rsquo;s letter. She had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
that gentle look of surprise in Miss Margaret&rsquo;s mild eyes
when she had placed John&rsquo;s letter in her hand, and no
doubt she would be yet more surprised when she asked
her to inclose her own to him. Yet John had requested
her to do this, and she must, of course, do as he wished.</p>

<p>So after awhile she sat down to write to him. She
had never written to him before, and this first love letter
was therefore a very serious affair. She began it
three times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear John&rdquo;&mdash;no, that was too cold. &ldquo;My own dearest
John&rdquo;&mdash;no, that was too warm! &ldquo;Dearest John;&rdquo;
yes, May thought that would do. Was he not her dearest
John? Not only her dearest John, but the dearest
to her of all on earth.</p>

<p>May thought this as she went on with her letter. She
told him how good and kind Miss Webster and Miss
Eliza were to her, and she told him also of all the places
and amusements they had taken her to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their nephew, Mr. Ralph Webster, has gone with us
generally, also,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;but oh! how I wish you
were here, John. It all seems like a beautiful new world
to me, but I miss you always. Still you must run no
risks for my sake. And John, dear John, do keep out
of the way of that wretched Mr. Henderson. Somehow
I am afraid of him, though I know he can do you no
harm. But he is a passionate-tempered man, I am certain,
and cruel, as we know after the way he behaved to
that poor, poor girl who shot herself. I wonder if her
spirit ever haunts him? Her memory must, I am certain,
for no doubt he broke her heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After she had once begun her letter May found it
quite easy to go on. It seemed almost as if she were
talking to John; telling him her thoughts as she had
done in the still garden at Woodside, when no one was
by to listen. Note-sheet after note-sheet she filled with
this fond prattling, until she suddenly remembered with
dismay that hers would be such a big letter for Miss
Webster to inclose to John. Still she could not part with
one word. She pressed her sheets together as tightly
as she could, and then went somewhat nervously down-stairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
with her letter in her hand to seek Miss Webster.</p>

<p>Miss Eliza had gone out to change her novel at the
nearest library, for Miss Eliza was a great lover of fiction,
and thus May found Miss Webster alone in the
dining-room industriously engaged in marking some
household linen. May felt that she colored painfully
when Miss Webster raised her kind eyes as she entered
the room and greeted May with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Eliza says you feel
rather tired this morning, and I am sorry for that. Is
there anything you would like? A glass of port wine
before lunch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, Miss Webster,&rdquo; answered May with a smile
and a pretty blush. &ldquo;There is really nothing the
matter with me&mdash;only I had a letter to write&mdash;to Mr.
Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Mr. Temple?&rdquo; repeated Miss Webster, looking
at the fair face of her young guest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he asked me to write,&rdquo; went on May, nervously;
&ldquo;and&mdash;and&mdash;Miss Webster, he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, what is it?&rdquo; asked Miss Webster,
gently, as May paused and hesitated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said if you would be so kind as to inclose my
letters to him he would like that best,&rdquo; said May, taking
courage. &ldquo;You see he is staying with his uncle,
and I believe his uncle&rsquo;s wife is rather an odd woman&mdash;so
he thinks it best that she should not know that
we write to each other at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Webster did not speak for a moment or two
after May had made this somewhat confused explanation.
But she was thinking very seriously. So this
young girl&rsquo;s visit to London was evidently a secret, she
was reflecting&mdash;a secret from Mr. John Temple&rsquo;s relations;
probably from May Churchill&rsquo;s own. The knowledge
of this made Miss Webster somewhat nervous.
She had the greatest belief and trust in Mr. John
Temple&mdash;had they not known him for years?&mdash;and she
was quite sure he would not do what was wrong to
anyone. Still, May was a young girl&mdash;and once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Miss Webster&rsquo;s gentle eyes rested on the young girl&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please do this for me, Miss Webster,&rdquo; pleaded May,
in her pretty way, laying her little white hand on Miss
Webster&rsquo;s thin, bluish-tinted one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must seem funny to you, I know, but it won&rsquo;t
some day&mdash;some day,&rdquo; she added, a little proudly,
raising her head, &ldquo;you will know that neither John
nor I are doing any wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure you are not,&rdquo; answered Miss Webster,
taking the little fluttering hand in hers. &ldquo;I have a
great regard for Mr. John Temple, and so has sister
Eliza. Yes, my dear, I will inclose your letter. You
will find some large envelopes lying on the writing-table
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the large envelope was duly directed to John
Temple, Esq., in the rather old-fashioned, shaky handwriting
of Miss Margaret Webster, and was carried to
the nearest post office by May herself, and sped on its
way, until the next morning it was lying on the breakfast
table at Woodlea Hall, near the seat that John
usually occupied while he was staying there.</p>

<p>The squire always opened the letter-bag, and passed
on the letters to their different owners, but it chanced
this morning that John Temple was not yet down when
his big letter arrived, neither was Mrs. Temple. Presently,
however, Mrs. Temple appeared, and looked first
at her own letters, and then at John&rsquo;s large one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What old woman, I wonder, is writing to John
Temple?&rdquo; she said, holding up the letter to attract her
husband&rsquo;s attention. &ldquo;Perhaps it contains one from a
young one.&rdquo; And she laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should not say such things as that, Rachel,&rdquo;
answered the squire, rather reprovingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; went on Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>At this moment John Temple opened the dining-room
door, and walked up to his place at the table, while
Mrs. Temple still had his letter in her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Mrs. Temple; good-morning, uncle,&rdquo;
said John, pleasantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, nephew John,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
Temple, with just a touch of defiance in her tone.
&ldquo;Do you see I am meddling with your property?&rdquo;
And she placed the letter in his hand. &ldquo;I have just
been admiring the handwriting of your lady correspondent,
and the size and fullness of her epistle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John&rsquo;s brown face colored slightly, and he put out
his hand for his letter, but that was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, looking at it with affected carelessness,
&ldquo;this is from my landlady in town, and no doubt
contains all my unpaid bills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you had no unpaid bills,&rdquo; retorted Mrs.
Temple, smiling. &ldquo;Your uncle, on my suggesting that
he should pay some of mine, held you up as a pattern
in the matter of bills. &lsquo;John owes nothing,&rsquo; he said;
now it appears to me that if that envelope contains
nothing but bills, that John must owe a great deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rachel, do not talk nonsense,&rdquo; interrupted the
squire, moving his newspaper restlessly. &ldquo;John, what
will you take?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John put his letter into his pocket before he made
his choice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me hide my bills first,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thanks,
uncle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have some cold grouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the subject of John&rsquo;s letter was dropped for the
present, but Mrs. Temple had not forgotten it. She
waited until the squire went out of the room, and then
went up to John, smilingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my nephew John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you
now to study your unpaid bills; or,&rdquo; she added archly,
&ldquo;to read your love letters from an old woman, and one,
maybe, from a young one, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it were so,&rdquo; replied John, as Mrs. Temple
laughed and moved toward the door of the room; &ldquo;but
I am not so fortunate as you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the moment she had disappeared his expression
changed, and he hastily drew out the envelope Miss Webster
had directed, and found inside the letter from May.
This also he quickly opened, and his face softened
strangely as he read the tender words it contained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;May, dear little May,&rdquo; he murmured to himself,
half-aloud, &ldquo;and you miss me, darling, do you? but not
more, not half so much, May, as I miss you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He read her long letter twice, and then put it into his
pocket, and going into the hall, took a cap from the hat-stand,
and strolled out into the park. The mist lay on
the dewy grass and floated in the air, blurring the
landscape somewhat, and hanging shadow-like around
the trees. But John Temple scarcely noticed the
atmosphere. He was trying to unravel some of the
problems of his life; to make a crooked path straight
for the sake of his young love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But for May I should not mind,&rdquo; he was thinking,
&ldquo;but I must shield May; she must never know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he thought of her as he had first seen her by
his young cousin&rsquo;s grave; thought of the day when he
had met her in the country lane gathering the hedge
roses; and of those other meetings when they had
drifted nearer and nearer to each other&rsquo;s hearts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good man would have fled from temptation, I
suppose,&rdquo; he replied, gloomily enough. &ldquo;But I did not,
and now&mdash;it is too late.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>A HARD BARGAIN.</small></h2>


<p>It was quite true that young Henderson had made a
terrible scene when he first heard that May Churchill
had disappeared from her home. He heard it from his
groom, Jack Reid, whom he now regarded with the most
bitter hate and fear, though he was obliged to suppress
these feelings.</p>

<p>Reid had, indeed, proved a hard task-master, and had
insisted on his price to the uttermost farthing. Henderson
had, no doubt with some difficulty, paid him one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
thousand pounds, and had tried in vain to avoid paying
him the other thousand, at least for a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do, you know, master,&rdquo; he had said, insolently
enough on Henderson making some excuse about
the money; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all very fine, but our bargain was
for two thousand, and you must keep your part of it if
I keep mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I tell you, man, I can not raise the money without
old Ormsby, the lawyer, being most inquisitive
about it, and asking all sorts of questions,&rdquo; answered
Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your money, not his, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; retorted Reid,
coolly. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s your debt, too, isn&rsquo;t it? Maybe if the
lawyer knew the truth he would think it wasn&rsquo;t much
to pay for your life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are always bringing that up,&rdquo; said Henderson,
gloomily.</p>

<p>He was looking very ill; people said he drank heavily,
and certainly his naturally clear brown complexion had a
different hue now to what it used to have. He was irritable,
too, and excitable to a painful extent, and his unhappy
mother lived in constant dread of some outbreak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth is, master,&rdquo; went on Jack Reid, quite
coolly, a few moments later, &ldquo;I really want this money
down, and I must ha&rsquo; it too, for I am thinking of starting
a race-horse or two in a small way, and capital I
must have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never would be so mad!&rdquo; cried Henderson, in
a sudden passion. &ldquo;You would just throw away the
money and get into all sorts of debts and troubles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many a man has begun on less,&rdquo; continued Reid,
contemplatively. &ldquo;I know a good horse when I see one,
and anyhow I mean to try&mdash;now Tom, my boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you speak to me thus?&rdquo; almost shouted
Henderson, growing pale with rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good many folks would say how dare you to speak
to me so?&rdquo; replied Reid, significantly.</p>

<p>Henderson did not speak; he stood there quivering
with passion, glaring at the man who was his master
and made him feel it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Tom, my boy,&rdquo; repeated Reid, with a short
and somewhat scornful laugh, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no good for us two
to quarrel. We both know too much, and we may as
well make the best of the situation. And what I was
about to propose is this: My two thousand pounds I will
ha&rsquo;; but what about you going into partnership with me
and making the capital four thousand? We could do
something with that, and then old Ormsby, the lawyer,
would not be surprised any longer at yer wanting the
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson swore a bitter oath, and cursed the man
before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do your worst!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go to the
bottomless pit as have anything more to do with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll find yer&rsquo;self there most likely, whether ye
have anything to do wi&rsquo; me or not,&rdquo; retorted Reid. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
no good swearing and cursing, my friend Tom; ye&rsquo;ve
got the rope round yer neck, remember, if I choose to
pull it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Henderson swore a tremendous oath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come, it&rsquo;s all very fine using big words,&rdquo; continued
Reid, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;re not business, and I mean business.
I think we could start very well on four thousand,
and ye&rsquo;d best think it over, for I&rsquo;ve been looking about
me, and I think I know a fellow who would let me his
place cheap, as he&rsquo;s a bit down in his luck at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been talking about this to other people,
have you?&rdquo; asked Henderson, savagely. &ldquo;What do you
suppose they will think? Where did you get the
money? they will ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reid winked one of his shrewd brown eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of all that, my boy,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve been throwing out hints lately that a relation
in Australia has died and left me money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would go there,&rdquo; said Henderson, eagerly
catching at the idea of getting rid of his incubus.
&ldquo;Australia&rsquo;s just the country for you, Reid. With your
capital you are sure to do well there, whereas this racing
stable business is an immense risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to try it, for all that,&rdquo; answered Reid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
sturdily, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t mean to be got rid of so easily
as to be pushed off to Australia or anywhere else. No,
I mean to try my luck where I am, and you&rsquo;d best think
over the proposal I&rsquo;ve made. However, partnership or
no partnership, I must ha&rsquo; the second thousand by next
week, so ye must raise it as best ye can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A savage, almost murderous, gleam shot from Henderson&rsquo;s
eyes as the man spoke, and Reid noticed this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That kind of thing won&rsquo;t do for the like o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; he
said, significantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well with a poor helpless
lass, but it&rsquo;s man to man wi&rsquo; us, and I&rsquo;d back
myself against ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again that terrible look passed over Henderson&rsquo;s
face, but with a great effort and an inward oath he
suppressed the words that rose to his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man and I shall not live together on the
earth,&rdquo; he silently swore, and from this hour he never
forgot his vow.</p>

<p>But Reid, reckoning on his own personal strength
perhaps, had no fear of his master. Nay, he seemed to
take a sort of grim pleasure in irritating him, and after
a few moments&rsquo; silence he began on the subject of May
Churchill&rsquo;s disappearance, of which he had just heard,
the report not having yet reached Henderson&rsquo;s ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ha&rsquo; ye heard the last news?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo; answered Henderson, sullenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About that bonnie lass fra&rsquo; Woodside Farm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Henderson, springing up erect, for he
had been leaning against one of the stable stalls during
the rest of this interview. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just hearsay wi&rsquo; me,&rdquo; replied Reid, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve
been told that Miss Churchill&rsquo;s run away fra&rsquo; home, and
no one can hear tell of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it; it&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; said Henderson, every
particle of color dying out of his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just some
confounded bit of gossip like the rest&mdash;but at all
events I&rsquo;ll ride over and see. Saddle Bob for me,
Reid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The groom proceeded leisurely to obey this order,
while Henderson stood by impatient and excited. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
kept repeating, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie; nothing but a lie;&rdquo; but Reid
could see that every limb of his body was quivering,
and that the report had agitated him almost beyond
control. The moment the horse was ready Henderson
sprang on his back and galloped out of the stable yard.
Nor did he draw rein until he reached Woodside Farm.
Then he hastily dismounted, and after giving his horse
in charge of one of the grooms, he strode to the house
door and violently rang the bell.</p>

<p>The maid who opened it said the master was out, but
the mistress was in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I see Mrs. Churchill?&rdquo; asked Henderson,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Churchill herself appeared at
the dining-room door. She had seen Henderson arrive
from the window, and now went forward to receive
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-afternoon, Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; she said, with
extended hand. &ldquo;Come in here. I suppose you have
heard what has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About May?&rdquo; gasped Henderson, who was pale and
trembling in every limb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, about May,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Churchill, calmly.
&ldquo;May has behaved in the most extraordinary manner;
she has run away from home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson did not speak; he staggered against a
chair; he grasped its back to support himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Churchill and I,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Churchill, still
calmly, &ldquo;had been away from home for a couple of
days, to my place at Castle Hill, and when we returned
the night before last, May had left a message with one
of the boys that she had a headache, and had gone to
bed. Well, yesterday morning she did not come down
to breakfast, and I went upstairs to look after her. Her
room was unoccupied, her bed had not been slept in;
in fact, she had disappeared. Her father went at once
to the station, and it appears from the station-master&rsquo;s
account she started for London in the afternoon of the
evening of our return. The whole thing had been
planned beforehand.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; faltered Henderson, for he could scarcely
speak the words, the violence of his emotion was so
great, &ldquo;was she&mdash;alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly alone. She had engaged a strange boy to
take her trunk to the station, and she had taken all her
best things with her. And she left a letter for her
father lying on the toilet-table of her room, in which
she falsely endeavored to blame me for her conduct.
She said she could not get on with me, so she had gone
away. But I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it; I believe I was
only a blind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson gave a sort of sigh of relief; after all,
May had gone alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean about a blind?&rdquo; he asked, after
a moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Henderson, I will trust you; I know you
liked this foolish girl, and you know what I wished concerning
yourself and her. Therefore, I expect this will
go no farther. But my belief is, that though she certainly
ran away with no one from here, that someone
will join her, and this is why I trust you. Do you
know of any lover&mdash;any admirer she had?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dark-red dusky flush rose to Henderson&rsquo;s pale face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson began moving restlessly up and down the
room with irregular footsteps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is that fellow,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;that is
to be Mr. Temple of Woodlea&rsquo;s heir, they say&mdash;well,
I&rsquo;ve seen May with him more than once. I saw her
with him just after the boy&rsquo;s death, and another time,&rdquo;
and then he suddenly paused, remembering that it was
in Fern Dene that he had twice seen May with John
Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know she knew him; she was thrown with him,
you see, when that unfortunate girl committed suicide,
but I scarcely think there could be anything between
them, though certainly on the very day of our return
here after our marriage trip, we found him here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You found him here?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but Mr. Churchill seemed to think nothing of
it, and I have never seen him here since; still, one
never can tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She changed to me from the day he came,&rdquo; went on
Henderson, in a broken voice; &ldquo;before that she was
always pleasant and friendly, if nothing more. If I
thought this fellow had induced May to leave her home
I would be even with him, that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Henderson, do not speak in that way.
We have really nothing to go on regarding Mr. John
Temple. As I have told you, I never saw him here
except that once, when we came home, and I have no
reason to believe she ever met him outside, and he certainly
did not run away with her. She went alone for
one thing, and for another Mr. John Temple is at present
at the Hall; Mr. Churchill saw him when he went
to tell the squire of May&rsquo;s disappearance on the morning
when we found she was gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything particular. Oh, yes, he said
May had never said anything to him of her intention of
leaving home. No, I think we may leave him out of
the question; now what I want to ask you is, is there
no one else, do you think, likely? Is there any young
farmer about here, or even in a lower class?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May never would look at them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what her father said, but one never can
tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; answered Henderson, roughly.
&ldquo;No, if it&rsquo;s anyone, it&rsquo;s this Temple! He&rsquo;s a sly, quiet
fellow, with a sneer on his face always, and if he&rsquo;s done
any harm to May he had best look to himself. He
came between her and me, I know; and he&rsquo;ll rue the
day, I swear it on my soul, if he&rsquo;s done any wrong to
the girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Henderson, this is folly,&rdquo; began Mrs.
Churchill.</p>

<p>But with a suppressed oath Henderson broke away
from her, leaving Mrs. Churchill not a little alarmed at
the wild recklessness of his whole manner and bearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
And when she told her husband of his visit he was not
over-well pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will never do, you know, Sarah, for this young
fellow to go raving about the country side, talking of
May and Mr. John Temple. We must remember the
squire is my landlord, and that Mr. Temple will be,
and I&rsquo;m told Henderson has been drinking heavily
lately, and has never been the same since that poor
girl&rsquo;s death. My opinion is we will hear of May some
day soon, and that she&rsquo;s gone off in a huff and taken
some situation or other, not with any young man or
lover at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mrs. Churchill saw the prudence of her husband&rsquo;s
advice, and talked no more of May&rsquo;s probable
lovers. Henderson, on the contrary, rode home with
every nerve in his body tingling, and his brain surging
with rage. His life, in fact, had become utterly unendurable
to him; his position with his groom, Reid, and
now the loss of May Churchill seemed actually to
madden him.</p>

<p>And the very day after he had seen Mrs. Churchill
he met John Temple riding along the road. It was to
this meeting that John had alluded in his letter to May,
and there was something in the dark, lowering look of
hate on Henderson&rsquo;s face, as he passed, that John was
not likely quickly to forget.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>MISS WEBSTER&rsquo;S HINT.</small></h2>


<p>Though Miss Webster had acceded to May&rsquo;s request,
and addressed her letter to John Temple, she did not
entirely forget the incident. In fact, it remained on
her mind, and she began to believe there was something
much more serious between John and May than
mere cousinship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>May&rsquo;s manner, too, had been very serious when she
had said that some day she would know there was nothing
wrong between herself and John. Miss Webster, in
fact, began to believe that there was a secret engagement
between them, and this belief disturbed her,
because she was getting anxious about her nephew,
Ralph Webster.</p>

<p>She did not know what made her think so, but still
she did think that Ralph was becoming very much
attached to their young guest. May was such a pretty
girl, and he was constantly thrown with her, so after
all it was only natural. Another thing, Ralph, who had
been so eager about his vacation holiday before May&rsquo;s
arrival, now seemed to have forgotten its existence.</p>

<p>Little things do not escape eyes sharpened by real
affection, and one evening shortly after she had
addressed May&rsquo;s letter to John Temple, Miss Webster
found the &ldquo;young people,&rdquo; as she called them, together
at the piano in the drawing-room, May playing and
Ralph Webster, with violin on shoulder, performing a
very fair accompaniment to May&rsquo;s music. True, Aunt
Eliza was also present, industriously knitting a violet
silk sock for her nephew Ralph, but still Miss Webster
felt uneasy. And presently when they paused they
both laughed good-naturedly, and Ralph looked around
and jokingly asked for applause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Margaret, Aunt Eliza, why don&rsquo;t you clap
your hands?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have never touched the
violin since I was a boy at school until I persuaded
Miss Churchill just now to allow me to try to accompany
her. And don&rsquo;t you think it was lovely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was lovely,&rdquo; laughed May Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seemed very nice, my dears,&rdquo; answered Aunt
Margaret, gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very nice,&rdquo; sighed Aunt Eliza, mildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To call anything &lsquo;very nice&rsquo; is an insult, I consider,&rdquo;
went on Ralph Webster, with a laugh. &ldquo;It
means you don&rsquo;t admire my performance, but that at
the same time you do not wish to hurt my feelings.
Pretty girls are told they look &lsquo;very nice&rsquo; by jealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
sisters and rivals, and there is no warmth in such an
opinion! Never mind, Miss Churchill, see if we can&rsquo;t
do better next time&mdash;what have you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stooped down and began to turn over May&rsquo;s
music as he spoke, asking for this piece or that. But
May naturally had no great assortment, as she had
brought no music with her, and all she possessed was
what she had bought in town since her arrival.</p>

<p>She turned round on the music-stool, however, and
bent down to assist Webster in his search, and as she
did so for a moment, partly by accident, he laid his hand
on hers. It was only a touch, but Aunt Margaret,
watching them, saw a glow, a sudden light gleam in
Ralph Webster&rsquo;s eyes, and a flush rise to his somewhat
sunken cheeks. Then, she looked at the girl&rsquo;s fair
face, but it was calm and placid as a summer&rsquo;s day.
She had scarcely noticed the touch that had thrilled
through his strong frame. Aunt Margaret fidgeted in
her seat; she was one of those quiet women who we
forget have once been young; forget that they too
have had their deep joys, their silent sorrows, their
withered hopes. Yet with Margaret Webster this had
been so, and there was a green grave in a distant
country churchyard, where the one she had loved best
lay still in his unbroken sleep. Only a common story,
but it made Margaret Webster understand the glow on
her nephew&rsquo;s cheeks, and the unruffled pale pink bloom
on May&rsquo;s. The man loved and the girl was indifferent,
and Miss Webster&rsquo;s gentle heart shrank from the probable
pain that Ralph Webster would endure.</p>

<p>The idea nerved her to take some action. She waited
till May and Aunt Eliza also had retired for the night,
and while her nephew went on with his pipe she suddenly
broached the subject of his holiday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not going away at all this year, Ralph?&rdquo;
she asked, &ldquo;for you see September is drawing to a close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph drew his pipe from his firm lips, and looked
steadily at his aunt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any motive for asking that, Aunt Margaret?&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Webster hesitated. Her faded cheeks flushed
slightly; her thin hands moved uneasily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you have,&rdquo; went on Ralph Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Ralph, I have,&rdquo; replied Miss Webster, with an
effort. &ldquo;You see Miss Churchill is still with us, and for
the present likely to remain, and I am not quite easy in
my mind about something. I know nothing, you know,
my dear; but still something a little strange, I think,
occurred the other day, and I think it better to tell you.
You remember Mr. John Temple wrote to ask us to
receive his young cousin for a short time? A fortnight,
I think he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Webster nodded his head; he was listening
intently to his aunt&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were only too happy to do this, both Eliza and
myself,&rdquo; continued Miss Webster. &ldquo;We have both the
greatest regard and friendship for Mr. John Temple;
but the other day I got a letter from him inclosing one
for May Churchill, which, of course, I at once gave
her, and the same day May gave me a very large letter
to inclose to Mr. John Temple. It seemed strange, did
it not? As if there were some secret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still Ralph did not speak. His dark, marked brows
were knitted; he was evidently thinking deeply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; proceeded Miss Webster, &ldquo;when I hesitated
a little, just a little, about inclosing her letter to Mr.
John Temple, May suddenly said, &lsquo;I know all this must
seem strange to you, Miss Webster, but some day you
will understand it; some day you will know that
neither John nor I are doing any wrong&rsquo;&mdash;or words to
that effect at least.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you addressed the letter to Temple?&rdquo; asked
Ralph Webster, in a low, concentrated voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, I did. I addressed it to him at Woodlea
Hall, and May went out and posted it herself&mdash;and&mdash;and,
Ralph, I have considered it over, and I thought
it best to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Ralph Webster nodded his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said, briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see you have been a good deal thrown with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
her,&rdquo; went on Miss Webster, apologetically, &ldquo;and May
is such a pretty girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You thought I might lose my heart to someone
engaged to another man, eh, Aunt Margaret?&rdquo; interrupted
Ralph Webster, as his aunt paused, but though
his lips smiled, there was a ring of pain in his voice.
&ldquo;Well, Aunt Margaret, perhaps I am safer away&mdash;thank
you for the hint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, my dear,&rdquo; said Miss Webster, rising, and
gently kissing his brow. But though she listened and
waited long to hear the sound of Ralph&rsquo;s footsteps also
going to his room, she did not hear them. For it was
morning, and Miss Webster was sleeping her placid
sleep, when a pale, haggard-faced man stole quietly up
the staircase, afraid to awaken the other inmates of the
house.</p>

<p>Yet later in the day Ralph Webster went down to
breakfast with no sign of any inward conflict on his
resolute face. Perhaps he was a shade paler than usual,
but that was all. His manner at least showed nothing.
He talked in the same fashion to May as he had talked the
night before, and to his aunts. But just when breakfast
was over, he made a little announcement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I am obliged to tear myself away
to-day from your pleasant society,&rdquo; he said, without
addressing anyone in particular; &ldquo;Bedford, a friend of
mine, is starting to-day for a fortnight&rsquo;s trip to Switzerland,
and I proposed to go with him; I can not very
well get off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a pleasant change, my dear,&rdquo; said Aunt
Margaret, in a faltering voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very pleasant,&rdquo; echoed Miss Eliza, in a disappointed
tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you will enjoy it!&rdquo; said May Churchill, heartily,
looking frankly in his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; answered Ralph Webster. &ldquo;Shall I
bring you some edelweiss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, do; bring us all some,&rdquo; replied May,
brightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ice-flower,&rdquo; said Ralph Webster, slowly, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
his deep, serious eyes fixed on her face. But the next
moment he roused himself and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good-by, Miss Churchill; I suppose I shall find
you here on my return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said May, and a slight fluttering blush
rose to her smooth cheeks.</p>

<p>Then Webster took leave of his two aunts, who followed
him to the street door, and waited until the cab
he whistled for arrived. But just before he left the
room he looked back at May; there was a look on her
face as if she were thinking of something, but Webster
felt vaguely it was not of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am better away,&rdquo; he thought, as he seated himself
in the cab and waved his hand to his aunts. But all
the same he sighed deeply as he lost sight of Pembridge
Terrace.</p>

<p>And the week after he was gone seemed very quiet
without him to the three ladies there. His comings
and goings had made a little stir each day, and he had
brought in the news, and it certainly was not so lovely
as before. Miss Eliza, however, found consolation in
gazing into the shop windows down Westbourne Grove,
and Miss Webster in her household duties. And just
ten days after he left, news came to May which filled
her whole being with excitement.</p>

<p>It was contained in a letter from John Temple; a
letter duly forwarded under cover to Miss Webster, and
placed in May&rsquo;s hand by that lady with a little tremulous
sigh. But five minutes after she had received it
May returned to the room with a face beaming with
joy, and cheeks covered with blushes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Webster!&rdquo; she cried, and ran up impetuously
and kissed that kind lady; &ldquo;John is coming! He is
coming to-morrow; there is only one more day to wait,
and he will be here!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>NEWS.</small></h2>


<p>May was in a state of great excitement all the day
after receiving John Temple&rsquo;s letter. She was so restless
she could not stay in the house; but it was evidently
a happy restlessness. She went out to shop,
and bought all sorts of pretty knick-knacks, and sorely
troubled Miss Eliza&rsquo;s mind by her extravagance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, it won&rsquo;t matter now,&rdquo; she said, sweetly,
when Miss Eliza ventured to remonstrate, and there
was such a glad look in her eyes as she spoke that her
gentle companion had not the heart to say anything
further.</p>

<p>The truth was that John Temple was not only coming,
but in his letter he had told May that they would
be married at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am weary of waiting, my Mayflower,&rdquo; he had
written, &ldquo;and am longing for the sight of your dear
face and the touch of your dear hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sweet, welcome words that thrilled through the girl&rsquo;s
heart, making the world all sunshine! May had always
trusted John, but she had felt that in her position waiting
was very trying, though she had never for a
moment blamed him for the delay. She judged his
love by hers; his heart by her own. But now it was
all over&mdash;the anxiety, the uncertainty. John would be
with her to-morrow, and her life henceforth would be
full of joy.</p>

<p>She counted the hours until they should meet, as
many a fond, foolish woman has counted them before.
She brought out her prettiest frocks; she smiled at her
fair reflection in the glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will he think I am looking?&rdquo; she thought, and
she wondered, too, if she would see any change in him.</p>

<p>The two quiet sisters down-stairs looked at each other
with sympathetic sighs. Miss Margaret had never told
Miss Eliza about her conversation with Ralph Webster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
but somehow Miss Eliza had vaguely understood that
some such conversation had taken place. She, too, had
been afraid for the son of their love; she, too, had
watched Ralph&rsquo;s dark eyes follow the slender girlish
form, whose heart was now beating so joyously at the
prospect of meeting another man!</p>

<p>But they did not speak of it. Miss Webster had said
quietly to Miss Eliza during the morning, &ldquo;Mr. John
Temple is coming to-morrow,&rdquo; and therefore Miss Eliza
concluded that May&rsquo;s happy looks and excitement were
somehow connected with this event.</p>

<p>She, indeed, made no secret of this, and when the
day actually came she went out the very first thing in
the morning, and returned laden with flowers, with
which she proceeded to fill Miss Webster&rsquo;s blue china
vases all over the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, you have quite a flower show,&rdquo; said Miss
Webster, kindly, looking at the glowing blossoms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is very fond of flowers,&rdquo; answered May, with
a soft happy blush, going on with her task; and
Miss Webster turned away thinking sadly enough of
Ralph Webster at some Alpine village among the
snow.</p>

<p>But May Churchill never thought of him. Her whole
mind was taken up with one idea. &ldquo;John is coming
to-day; John is coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thought made her go singing about the house; it
deepened the lovely rose-bloom on her cheeks, and
made her eyes shine like stars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is beautiful,&rdquo; whispered Aunt Eliza to Aunt
Margaret, when the girl came down dressed for dinner
in her white frock, with moss-rose buds at her breast
and throat.</p>

<p>John Temple was expected a little before seven
o&rsquo;clock, and a little after seven o&rsquo;clock he came. We
may be sure May was waiting and watching for
him, and when she heard a cab stop before the house
door she ran into the hall to welcome him. And a
moment or two later John came in, and the two clasped
each other&rsquo;s hands in silence, and then John drew May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
into the dining-room, the door of which was standing
open, and clasped her to his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own love, my own dear love,&rdquo; he whispered,
with his lips on hers.</p>

<p>But presently May drew back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me look at you,&rdquo; she said softly, raising her
beautiful eyes and looking into his gray ones. She had
pictured his face so often in her day-dreams; pictured
it looking down at her as it was looking now, full of
love, and with a little sigh of rest the next moment her
white eyelids fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not changed,&rdquo; she murmured below her
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you I would never change?&rdquo; answered
John Temple. &ldquo;My Mayflower, I will not change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Miss Margaret in the kitchen was getting
exceedingly uneasy that her turbot would be over-boiled
and her ducks over-roasted. She therefore put
up her head from the kitchen stairs and called to Aunt
Eliza, who speedily came to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eliza, if without disturbing them, you know, dear,
do you think you could give them to understand that
dinner is ready?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>

<p>Aunt Eliza nodded her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Knock at the door,
or cough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To knock would be too marked, I think,&rdquo; answered
Aunt Margaret. &ldquo;I should just give a little cough, or
a gentle sneeze outside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is all very well to be told to sneeze when you do
not want to do so, but it is almost an impossibility.
Miss Eliza, however, proceeded to the dining-room
door and tried to do her best. She, in fact, emitted a
most extraordinary sound which was intended to represent
a sneeze. But at all events it had the intended
effect. The lovers started apart as if they had been
shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds as if someone was choking outside,&rdquo;
answered John; &ldquo;shall I see what it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>He accordingly opened the door, and there stood poor
Aunt Eliza in the very act of preparing to attempt to
sneeze again!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Eliza,&rdquo; said John, warmly grasping her hand,
&ldquo;and how are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a few moments Miss Eliza could make no
answer. She gasped for breath; she struggled to
regain her ordinary expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is Miss Webster?&rdquo; went on John, kindly.
&ldquo;I am very pleased indeed to see you both again, and
thank you very much for taking such care of my dear
little girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked back at May tenderly as he spoke, and
May smiled and went forward. By this time Miss
Eliza had partly recovered her speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, addressing May in a slightly
choking voice, &ldquo;if&mdash;if Mr. John Temple&mdash;is ready&mdash;dinner
is.&rdquo; And then a violent fit of coughing interrupted
her utterance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, you have forgotten to take off your overcoat!&rdquo;
said May, with a little laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I have,&rdquo; answered John, going out into the hall
to remove it; and when he went back into the room he
once more shook Miss Eliza&rsquo;s kind hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looks very well,&rdquo; he said, with a smile, and a
glance at May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweetly pretty,&rdquo; answered Miss Eliza, with a little
gentle sigh.</p>

<p>Then presently Miss Webster appeared, followed by
her parlor maid, with the dinner. Everything was well
cooked, to Miss Webster&rsquo;s great satisfaction, and John
Temple did fair justice to her good things. May, however,
could not eat. &ldquo;I am too happy,&rdquo; she was thinking,
as time after time she raised her eyes shyly to
John&rsquo;s good-looking face.</p>

<p>Then, when dinner was over and the ladies were
about to retire to the drawing-room, John laid a detaining
hand on Miss Webster&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I have a few words alone with you?&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, certainly,&rdquo; answered Miss Webster, nervously.</p>

<p>By this time Aunt Eliza and May Churchill had left
the room, for they also had heard John Temple&rsquo;s
request, and Miss Webster having resumed her chair,
John drew his close to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about May Churchill, Miss Webster, that I want
to speak to you,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I do not know whether
you have guessed the truth, but May and I are engaged,
and are going to be married immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought there must be something&mdash;&rdquo; answered
Miss Webster, and then she paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to be married at once,&rdquo; continued
John, speaking as though he had planned beforehand
what to say, &ldquo;but I am sorry to tell you our marriage
for the present must be a secret one. My uncle, Mr.
Temple of Woodlea, is an old-fashioned man, with
many class prejudices, and May is not what he would
consider, nay does consider, exactly in my position of
life. Her father, in truth, is a tenant-farmer, one of
my uncle&rsquo;s tenants, and he never would give his consent
to our marriage. Her young brothers also, unfortunately,
played in the game of football when poor
young Phil Temple was killed, and Mrs. Temple, my
uncle&rsquo;s wife, has an extraordinary prejudice on this
account against the whole family. Thus you see it
would never do for me, during my uncle&rsquo;s life, to marry
May openly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she know this?&rdquo; asked Miss Webster, quickly,
her delicate complexion flushing as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly she knows it; knows that only on these
conditions we could be married&mdash;do you understand,
dear Miss Webster? I admit I deceived you; I called
May my cousin, and she is not my cousin, but I could
not explain all this to you at the time, and my object
was naturally to get a respectable home for May until
I could marry her; and I knew she would have this
with you, and so will you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And her parents?&rdquo; asked Miss Webster, moving
her hands uneasily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Her mother is dead, and her father recently married
again, and his new wife has made May&rsquo;s home life
wretched since she has been at Woodside. She is a
vulgar person, I believe, and, moreover, she has taken
into her head that May ought to marry a brutal young
man who lives in those parts, and who very narrowly
escaped being tried for murder lately. He certainly
behaved disgracefully to a poor girl he had treated
most cruelly, and who either shot herself, or whom he
shot. At all events, this Henderson is a person not fit
to speak to May. Yet this Mrs. Churchill pestered her
continually about him, and finally May determined to
leave her home to escape her persecution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;do they know about&mdash;you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word, nor must they know. May left a letter
for her father to tell him she was leaving because she
could not get on with her stepmother, and this is enough
explanation for her to give. The rest is between ourselves.
I mean to marry May at once, and take her
abroad for a short time, and then, Miss Webster, I have
a proposition to make to you, to which I most earnestly
hope you will agree. I can not acknowledge my marriage
to May for the present, and she is too young to live
alone. So will you allow her to remain an inmate of
your house? Of course, she shall have a handsome
income, and I know she is fond of both you and Miss
Eliza, and my mind would be at rest regarding her if I
knew she was under your kindly care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Webster had given a sort of gasping sigh more
than once during this long speech of John&rsquo;s. In fact,
it nearly took her breath away. A secret marriage!
The bride to be left with them! No wonder gentle
Miss Webster&rsquo;s soft gray hair nearly rose on end at the
idea. It was so completely against her ideas of propriety
and against dear Eliza&rsquo;s also. Miss Webster, in fact, did
not know what to say; she fidgeted in her chair; her
thin fingers moved nervously; her whole appearance
denoted her mental distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know all this must be a little startling to you,&rdquo;
continued John Temple, &ldquo;but just consider the circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
and how the poor girl was actually compelled
to fly from home to escape a hateful marriage that was
being forced on her! We&mdash;May and I&mdash;love each
other very dearly, and she is content to accept this sacrifice
for my sake, and she shall never regret it. My
whole future life shall be devoted to her; and at all
events, Miss Webster, even if you won&rsquo;t help us, I am
sure our secret will be quite safe with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your secret will be quite safe,&rdquo; replied Miss Webster,
still rather stiffly. She was thinking she was a
clergyman&rsquo;s daughter, and wondering what would be
her duty under such extraordinary circumstances. And
then suddenly the remembrance of Ralph Webster
flashed across her mind, and her faded cheeks colored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think this arrangement would hardly be suitable,
Mr. Temple,&rdquo; she said, with hesitation and downcast
eyes. &ldquo;You see, our nephew, Mr. Ralph Webster,
almost lives with us, and&mdash;and of course, though May&mdash;I
beg your pardon, the future Mrs. John Temple&mdash;is
a dear sweet girl, and both of us, my sister Eliza and
myself, are, if you will excuse me saying so, very fond
of her. Still, though Ralph has rooms in the Temple,
he looks on this as his home; and, indeed, it ought to
be, as he is our poor dear brother&rsquo;s only child, but still,
as he is a young man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple laughed softly as Miss Webster concluded
her confused protest against his proposal that
May should live with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not be jealous,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;your nephew, I
presume, is only a very young man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no! Our poor dear brother was very much
older than we are, you know. Ralph is past thirty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Past thirty?&rdquo; replied John Temple, thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he added, and he smiled as he spoke, &ldquo;I should
not be afraid of May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not of May&mdash;&rdquo; began Miss Webster, and then
she paused, painfully confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said John, rising, &ldquo;talk it over with Miss
Eliza. I will send her to you, and go and talk to May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be best,&rdquo; answered Miss Webster, relieved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and a few moments later Miss Eliza entered the room,
and Miss Webster in an awe-struck whisper told her
news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would never do; you see it would never do,&rdquo; she
concluded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would never do,&rdquo; echoed Aunt Eliza, dolefully,
shaking her head and sighing dismally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be unjust&mdash;to Ralph,&rdquo; said Miss Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Terribly unjust,&rdquo; repeated Aunt Eliza, heaving
another sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we must agree to decline. I am sure she is
a sweet girl, and if there was anything I could do for
her I would do it, and you, too, Eliza, but we must
consider&mdash;others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; and after this the sisters kissed each
other, and then went together nervously toward the
drawing-room. But when they entered the room nothing
was said of their consultation. John Temple was
sitting by May on a couch, looking perfectly content,
and May was smiling and looking perfectly happy.
John rose with a pleasant smile as the two trembling
old ladies appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Miss Webster, and Miss Eliza,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come
and help May here to decide a most knotty question.
Where will you sit? Now, Miss Webster, let us have
your opinion first. What should May wear to be married
in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;White, I should think,&rdquo; answered Miss Webster,
somewhat feebly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, John, I told you so!&rdquo; cried May, triumphantly.</p>

<p>John made an awry face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Miss Webster, to what I have to get accustomed,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But John, you know you like me in white best,&rdquo;
continued May; &ldquo;at least you always said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I do, but as we are going on our travels straight
from the church, I thought something dark would be
more useful. However, of course, have your own way,
and to-morrow these ladies perhaps will go out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
help us to buy a very smart traveling cloak and whatever
else you require. We are going direct to Paris,
Miss Webster, as this young lady has never seen that
lively city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John talked on thus until he rose to take his leave for
the night, but even then he said nothing of his proposition
to Miss Webster. But the next morning he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you thought over what I said last night, Miss
Webster?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Temple,&rdquo; answered Miss Webster, falteringly,
&ldquo;and we think&mdash;sister Eliza and I think&mdash;that
it would be better if&mdash;the future Mrs. John Temple did
not live in this house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is settled then,&rdquo; said John Temple, calmly;
&ldquo;but perhaps you will kindly help May to find a suitable
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only too delighted to do anything for such a sweet
young creature,&rdquo; replied kind Miss Webster; &ldquo;I assure
you, Mr. Temple; both sister Eliza and myself have the
greatest regard for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, very much, and now we must see about the
preparations for the marriage at once. She must be
married in this parish, of course; so will you kindly tell
me who your parson is, and give me an introduction to
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this the preparations for the marriage went on
as quickly as possible, both Miss Webster and Miss
Eliza assisting in every way that they could. But we
will let Miss Webster describe that event in a letter
which she addressed to her nephew, Ralph Webster, a
few hours after it was over. She wrote this letter with
a sad heart somehow, but she little guessed of the bitter
and intense pain with which it was received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dearest Ralph</span>: I have some strange news for
you,&rdquo; one midday Ralph Webster read at the Swiss
chalet where he was staying. &ldquo;Our young guest,
May Churchill, was married this morning to Mr. John
Temple, and both sister Eliza and myself were present
at the ceremony. But what I most regret to have to
tell you is that this marriage is a secret one, and neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Mr. Temple&rsquo;s relatives nor her own have the slightest
knowledge of it. We have indeed promised to reveal
it to no one, but we make an exception in your case,
as you are our near and dear relation, and also because
we are quite certain we can trust this secret with
you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reasons for secrecy are, Mr. John Temple
informed us, that his uncle, Mr. Temple, of whom he is
the heir, would not hear of the marriage, and also that
May&rsquo;s parents, her father and stepmother, desired her
greatly to marry another gentleman who lives in their
neighborhood, and who, by Mr. John Temple&rsquo;s account,
is of bad character. May seemed very happy, and
looked sweetly pretty during the marriage service,
which was performed by our vicar, Mr. Mold, and we
can only pray and hope that every blessing and happiness
may attend the young couple who are beginning
life together under what, to our poor human foresight,
do not appear very fortunate circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They started immediately after the ceremony was
over for Paris, but before leaving Mr. John Temple
made, what we considered, rather a strange proposal to
sister Eliza and myself, which was, that on their return
to England, that Mrs. John Temple should come back
to reside with us in this house, while he proceeded to
his uncle&rsquo;s residence. But after due consideration,
sister Eliza and myself came to the conclusion that this
arrangement was not desirable. But we have agreed
to endeavor to find her a suitable house during their
sojourn abroad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now having told you my news, and with kindest
love from sister Eliza and myself, I remain, my
dearest Ralph, your ever affectionate aunt,</p>

<p class="right">&rdquo;<span class="smcap">Margaret Webster</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P. S.&mdash;We were exceedingly glad to learn from your
letter that you were in good health, and enjoying the
invigorating air of the mountains.</p>

<p class="right">M. W.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Webster read this long letter through, and his
strong face grew a little gray-tinted as he did so. He
had never realized until now what a terrible blow this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
marriage was to him; never dreamed that the girl&rsquo;s face
that he had seen a hundred times in his mental vision
amid the glaciers and the snowdrifts had become so
dear to him.</p>

<p>Now he knew that it was so, but he bore his pain
bravely and silently. He went out from the chalet
alone, down a rugged stony slope, with the snow deep
on either side, and the green ice glistening at his feet.
He was thinking of the woman he loved&mdash;now when
he knew he loved her, when he knew she was utterly
lost to him&mdash;with strange, even pathetic tenderness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not thought much of women nor love before,&rdquo;
he was reflecting. &ldquo;She has been the only one,&rdquo; and
he drew his firm lips closer, &ldquo;and the only one she shall
remain.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>ILL-WILL.</small></h2>


<p>The ill-will between Tom Henderson and his groom
Reid did not diminish as time went on. For one thing,
to raise a sum like two thousand pounds was not an
easy matter to the young squire of Stourton Grange;
for another, Reid&rsquo;s manner when alone with his master
grew almost intolerable.</p>

<p>He was insolent and overbearing, and bought horses
and sold them, often actually using the stables at Stourton
for his own purposes. In vain Henderson stormed
and swore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve the whip hand of ye, ye know, master,&rdquo; Reid
would say in reply, with a significant look, and Henderson
swore to himself many a time that this state of
things should not go on.</p>

<p>And there was another element in his life&mdash;a dark,
threatening dread&mdash;of which Henderson was only too
conscious. This was the bitter animosity that the landlord
of the Wayside Inn, James Wray, was said to nourish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
against him. Reid had warned him of this, for
Henderson&rsquo;s life was too valuable to himself not to be
taken good care of, and with brutal frankness the groom
had told Henderson of his danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, master, ye had best look out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
told, and the fellow who told me knew what he was
about, that old Wray swears he&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; a shot at ye the
first time ye cross his way. And they say he carries his
pistols about wi&rsquo; him wherever he goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson made no reply to this piece of information.
But it came to him also from another source, for one
day he received an ill-written, badly-spelt letter from
Alice, the barmaid of the Wayside Inn, warning him
&ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake not to go near their place, as master
has sworn to have your blood if ever he sets his eyes on
you, and this would make more trouble than has already
been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The letter went on to say that at times &ldquo;the master
was like one dement,&rdquo; and that they were afraid of their
lives. Henderson did not doubt that the girl&rsquo;s words
were true, and that this dark shadow hung like a suspended
sword over his head. At times he grew almost
reckless, but at others the grim penalty of his hidden
crime filled his soul with shuddering dread.</p>

<p>After May Churchill&rsquo;s disappearance he more than
once gave way to frightful paroxysms of passion and
rage, terrifying his unhappy mother with his mad words
and frantic gestures. But weeks passed&mdash;three weeks,
nearly a month after May&rsquo;s flight&mdash;and still John Temple
remained at the Hall, and even the jealous Henderson
was forced to admit that this did not look as if Temple
had anything to do with it. Then one day as Henderson
was moodily riding down one of the country lanes
he suddenly met Mrs. Temple, of the Hall, who was
driving, and to his great surprise, she pulled up her
ponies.</p>

<p>Henderson had never seen her since the great scandal
about himself and poor Elsie Wray had occurred, and
he was by no means sure that she would take any notice
of him now. He put up his hand nervously therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
to take off his hat, but Mrs. Temple stopped, and so he
also drew rein.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a long time since I
last saw you, Mr. Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, rather huskily, while a dusky
flush spread over his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come and see us?&rdquo; continued Mrs.
Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not sure you would care to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple gave a little airy shrug of her handsome
shoulders. She was looking very well, and had apparently
got over her deep grief for the loss of her boy, and
at one time Henderson had been rather a frequent visitor
at Woodlea Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I shall be glad to see you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I lost my nephew yesterday, you know,&rdquo; she added;
&ldquo;John Temple has gone away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone away?&rdquo; echoed Henderson, sharply, and the
dusky flush faded from his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has gone for a week or so, I believe; abroad,
I think, but he was rather vague about his movements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson did not speak. Had he gone to May, he
was thinking, with a sharp and bitter pang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the by,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Temple, &ldquo;has anything
ever been heard of that pretty girl, Miss Churchill, who
ran away from home? You were one of her swains,
were you not, Mr. Henderson?&rdquo; And Mrs. Temple
laughed and showed her white teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew them very well, at all events,&rdquo; muttered Henderson,
with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you were one of her many admirers, they told
me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple, with a smile. &ldquo;Well, she certainly
is pretty; such a fine complexion. John Temple
called her beautiful; do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is handsome,&rdquo; said Henderson, hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am rather curious about her flight, or disappearance,
or whatever it was. Will you call to-morrow
at four o&rsquo;clock and tell me all about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know nothing,&rdquo; began Henderson, but Mrs. Temple
stopped him with a little wave of her driving whip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind; call to-morrow at four; and now good-morning,
Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; and she nodded her head
and drove on.</p>

<p>But for a moment or two Henderson sat still on his
saddle after she had passed him. What did she mean,
he was asking himself. Did she suspect that there was
anything between John Temple and May Churchill?
that he had anything to do with her flight?</p>

<p>This idea which had haunted Henderson in spite of
himself now recurred to his mind with threefold force.
At all events he would go to the Hall and hear what
Mrs. Temple had to say. And he did go, and was
received by Mrs. Temple, who smilingly held out her
hand to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she said in that half-reckless way which
was one of her characteristics, &ldquo;I have not turned my
back on you in spite of your troubles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very good of you,&rdquo; answered Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, being a parson&rsquo;s daughter, I have naturally a
spice of the devil in me, and a certain fellow-feeling to
sinners. All men are sinners, you know,&rdquo; she added,
with a laugh; &ldquo;even my paragon of a nephew, John
Temple!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo; asked Henderson, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he posed a great deal as a saint, but I don&rsquo;t
quite believe in it all. Now sit down and tell me about
Miss Churchill. Do you suppose she was induced to
run away by John Temple?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo; answered Henderson, darkly, with
lowering brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was something in his manner&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
what&mdash;that led me to believe that he knew more of the
matter than he chose to say. Of course he didn&rsquo;t run
away with her; but I wonder if he knows where she
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to find out. He promised to write to
his uncle when he went away, and if I get you his
address, do you think you would do something to oblige
me, Mr. Henderson?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do anything,&rdquo; replied Henderson, eagerly,
grasping at the meaning of her words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, a lady can&rsquo;t make certain inquiries,
but a young man can. If I got you John Temple&rsquo;s
address could you go and find out what he is doing?
If in fact he has joined Miss Churchill? If he has been
seen with her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get me the address and I will go,&rdquo; said Henderson,
with such a fierce gleam in his brown eyes that Mrs.
Temple drew back rather alarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind, I&rsquo;ll have no quarreling,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;only I want
to know if John Temple is speaking the truth. His
uncle spoke to him about this Miss Churchill, of course,
disapprovingly, and he said there was nothing between
them, and would not be. But how can we tell? He
may have married her secretly for anything we
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I thought&mdash;&rdquo; began Henderson, passionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t speak and look like that, or I won&rsquo;t give
you the address! I am going to have no throat-cutting.
All I want to know, is John Temple speaking the truth?
If you can find out this quietly, I will regard you in
future as a friend, and treat you as such in spite of
Mrs. Grundy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson&rsquo;s lips moved convulsively, but with a great
effort he controlled himself. He could only find out
Temple&rsquo;s address through Mrs. Temple, and therefore
he must not frighten or quarrel with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;get me the address, and I&rsquo;ll
find out all I can about him. And&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll treat me
as a friend I will be grateful&mdash;for I want one.&rdquo; And
he held out his hand, which Mrs. Temple took.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll live it down, no fear,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always pitied you. But you had better go now, for my
lord and master sometimes does not hold my views.
But when John Temple writes to his uncle I will forward
his address to you at once. And now, good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Henderson left Woodlea Hall with a new hope in
his heart. At all events he would be able to find out, if
Mrs. Temple gave him John Temple&rsquo;s address, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
there was any truth in the haunting suspicion which
had pursued his own mind. But a week passed and he
heard nothing from Mrs. Temple. And during this
week an incident occurred that roused to fury his smoldering
resentment against his groom, Jack Reid.</p>

<p>He had paid the man the two thousand pounds, and
heard rumors of Reid swaggering at markets and meetings,
but had declined to enter into any horse-racing
establishments with him. Reid had tried to bully, but
here Henderson was firm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no money, so it&rsquo;s no good speaking of it,&rdquo; he
had said.</p>

<p>What was his indignation, therefore, when one day
Reid coolly asked him to advance him another hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little mare I must have, and I&rsquo;m short a
hundred of her price; so, Henderson, my boy, ye must
shell out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson&rsquo;s brow grew black as night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s to be sold at Skidder&rsquo;s to-morrow,&rdquo; continued
Reid, &ldquo;and I thought I would take the dog-cart and
drive over in the morning, and borrow Brown Bess for
the occasion; for it&rsquo;s well always to make a good
appearance.&rdquo; And Reid gave an insolent laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Borrow my trap and horse if you dare!&rdquo; shouted
Henderson, hoarse with passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I dare; and I must have the hundred pounds,
too,&rdquo; answered Reid. &ldquo;Come, it&rsquo;s no use swearing; ye
may as well make things pleasant for us both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without another word Henderson turned on his heel
and strode away. The men had met in the avenue and
Reid saw Henderson walk rapidly back to the house
and disappear from his view. But it was impossible
almost to describe the furious rage that possessed Henderson&rsquo;s
soul as he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is too much,&rdquo; he muttered darkly between his
bitten lips, and he at once proceeded to his own room,
vowing vengeance as he went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall not live to insult me again,&rdquo; he swore
fiercely; and then he sat down deliberately and tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
think how he could best carry out his murderous intentions.</p>

<p>Reid saw nothing more of him during the day, but
after nightfall, about eight o&rsquo;clock, Henderson walked
down to the stables, where he was almost sure to find
Reid at this hour. The groom was there engaged in
looking after the horses, and he turned around and
nodded as his so-called master entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the money you asked for,&rdquo; said Henderson,
in a sullen tone, holding out a check, &ldquo;and I hope it&rsquo;s
the last you&rsquo;ll want for some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reid took the check and glanced at it, and then put
it in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said, and then he proceeded to
discuss the points of the animal he proposed to purchase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a real beauty,&rdquo; he said, and so on.</p>

<p>Henderson took very little notice. Presently, however,
he addressed the groom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talked of taking the trap and Brown Bess,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;if you do, what time will you be back, as I want
the trap to drive over in the evening to Captain
North&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time do you want to go?&rdquo; asked Reid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to be there by nine. It&rsquo;s a kind of sporting
supper he has on, and I promised to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll not take ye more than an hour to go to Newstead?
Well, I&rsquo;ll be back by seven, and ye better drive
one of the other horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Henderson, shortly, and then
without another word he left the stable, and Reid
looked after him curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked uncommon vicious,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;I
wonder if he can be planning any mischief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this idea recurred again to his mind when he
saw Henderson the next morning. There was a dark,
lowering, determined look on his face that Reid did
not like, and as he indulged in no strong language the
groom began to think it looked suspicious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be sure you are back by seven,&rdquo; was all Henderson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
said in allusion to their conversation of the night before;
and when he had turned away, Reid began whistling
softly to himself.</p>

<p>And all the day after Henderson was restless and
strange in his manner. He told his mother that he
would not be at home at dinner-time, as he was going
to Captain North&rsquo;s, and accordingly about half-past six
o&rsquo;clock he left the house, and proceeded on foot to a
lonely spot in the road, that he knew Reid must pass
on his return from Skidder&rsquo;s, the horse dealer&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>This part of the road ran through a little wood, and
there were trees on either side of the horse path.
Here behind the trunk of a great spreading oak Henderson
stationed himself with murder in his heart. He
meant to shoot Reid, cost him what it might, for the
man&rsquo;s insolence had become to him utterly unbearable.</p>

<p>It was nearly seven o&rsquo;clock when he reached the little
wood, and it was a cold, gray, drizzling evening, with
a fog floating over the lowlands, and there was a
general air of bleakness and discomfort in the whole
scene. But Henderson with his black passions roused
felt none of this. He stood there hidden, with his
revolver ready in his hand, and with his ear alert to
catch every sound. But none came; only the melancholy
moan of the wind through the trees, or the cry
of the curlew winging its way over the sedges on the
marsh below.</p>

<p>Henderson began to get impatient. Would he never
come, he thought. He looked at his watch again and
again; half-past seven, eight, and then the autumn day
began to close, and the night to gather in.</p>

<p>It was quite dark&mdash;just nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;when at last
he did hear the rumble of wheels and the sharp trot of
a horse&rsquo;s hoofs on the stony road. Henderson stood
breathless, his revolver raised ready to fire, his eyes
peering eagerly through the darkness and the mist.
The sounds came nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Brown Bess&rsquo; trot,&rdquo; he told himself with savage
glee; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have him this time and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dog-cart passed the spot where he was standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
a moment later, and Henderson fired. There was a
cry; the horse swerved violently aside, and then
started off in a furious gallop, and Henderson stood
panting on the roadway, wondering if his enemy were
dead.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>A GUILTY SOUL.</small></h2>


<p>He listened eagerly until the sound of the horse&rsquo;s
gallop grew fainter and fainter, and then Henderson
proceeded to carry out the plan which he had laid
down for himself. This was actually to go to Captain
North&rsquo;s supper, who was a somewhat disreputable
sporting man in the neighborhood, who, for reasons of
his own, had not given the cold shoulder to Henderson
during the time of the great scandal about him.</p>

<p>Henderson therefore turned and walked on quickly
in the direction of Captain North&rsquo;s place, Newstead.
It was only about a mile from the little wood where he
had fired the shot at Reid, and it did not take him long
to arrive there. A sort of savage exultation filled his
breast as he proceeded on his way. At all events, he
had wounded Reid, for he had heard the man&rsquo;s startled
cry. And the shot could not be traced to him, he
believed, for he would be known to be at North&rsquo;s supper
at the time, and in the darkness it was impossible
that Reid could have recognized him.</p>

<p>At Newstead he received a warm welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How late you are, old fellow!&rdquo; cried the host, a
dissipated red-faced man of fifty, rising from the table
and grasping Henderson&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; answered Henderson. &ldquo;Well, my mother
was not well, and so I did not start so early as I
intended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this he sat down to supper with the rest, and
seemed in high spirits. They were a rough lot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
altogether, and they all seemed bent on enjoying themselves.
They drank, laughed, joked, and sang, and
Henderson joined in the thick of it. It was indeed
after two in the morning before they began to talk of
dispersing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if my trap is here?&rdquo; asked Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered the servant he addressed; &ldquo;there
is nothing here from Stourton Grange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confound that fellow. I wonder why he has not
come; got drunk, as usual, I suppose,&rdquo; said Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that groom of yours, Reid?&rdquo; asked
Captain North. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told he&rsquo;s quite a swell now, and
goes about buying horses, and blustering about some
money he has had left him, or that he has power over
you, or something. I would get rid of him if I were
you, Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lazy dog,&rdquo; swore Henderson, and then the
conversation dropped.</p>

<p>One of the guests who was going Henderson&rsquo;s way
offered to give him a lift, and Henderson accepted the
offer. This man drove Henderson nearly to the avenue
at Stourton, and there they parted, Henderson proceeding
on foot in the direction of the Grange. As he
walked on in the darkness and the gloom, for the first
time since he had fired the shot at Reid, a sort of dread,
of shrinking from the consequences of what he had
done, stole over his soul. But he braced himself up to
conquer this feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He deserved it. I hope he is dead,&rdquo; he thought,
and in this mood he neared his home.</p>

<p>He had to pass the stables on his way, and as he did
so he saw they were fully lighted. He hesitated, then
nerved himself to go in and inquire why this was so.
He entered one of the open doors, and a peculiar gasping
sound fell on his ears. He passed two of the stalls,
and he saw the horses in them were restless and uneasy.
Then he came to the third stall&mdash;Brown Bess&rsquo; stall&mdash;and
such a sight met his eyes that he never forgot
it to his dying day.</p>

<p>Reid was standing there and a farrier whom he knew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
and on the straw of the stall lay Brown Bess, panting
and struggling in her death agonies. Blood was flowing
from her nostrils; blood from her distended jaws,
while convulsive tremors ran through her sleek and
glossy form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this? What has happened?&rdquo; asked Henderson,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>The two men, who had not noticed his approach, as
they were watching the horse, now turned around and
saw Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some scoundrel shot her on the road as we came
through Henley Wood,&rdquo; answered Reid, gloomily.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s shot through the lungs, Mr. Roberts here says&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s all up with her, poor beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Henderson, I fear nothing can be done,&rdquo;
said Mr. Roberts, the farrier, shaking his head.</p>

<p>Henderson gave a kind of cry, and knelt down on the
straw beside the dying horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess! Bess! My poor Bess! don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;
he exclaimed, and his words were broken by a sob.</p>

<p>The dumb creature in her death throes knew her
master&rsquo;s voice. She opened her fast glazing eyes a
little wider; she tried to whinny her welcome, but the
exertion killed her. A rush of blood came from her
mouth, a terrible struggle convulsed her limbs, and the
two men standing behind seized Henderson and pulled
him forcibly away from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She might kick you without knowing it, sir,&rdquo; said the
farrier. &ldquo;Ay, poor brute, it will be all over in a
moment or so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His words were true; there was another plunge or
two, then a faint quivering ran through her frame, and
then all was still. Henderson stood watching her, and
then with a groan he covered his face with his hand,
and turned away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad business,&rdquo; said the farrier. &ldquo;Who on earth
could have shot her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just at the turn in Henley Wood,&rdquo; repeated
Reid; &ldquo;we were coming home as nicely as could be
when I heard a shot close at hand. Poor Bess a-kind o&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
jumped in the air, and then started galloping, and
never stopped till we got to the stable door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you saw no one?&rdquo; asked the farrier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a living soul; it was too dark,&rdquo; answered Reid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what were you doing out so late?&rdquo; asked Henderson,
in a strange, hollow voice, now looking at his
groom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ye know, master, I&rsquo;d been buying that mare
I told you of, and Skidder and I wet the bargain, and I
got a bit tight. But I waited till I was all right, and
then I was driving away quietly home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sacrificed her life,&rdquo; interrupted Henderson,
darkly and sternly, &ldquo;the best horse a man ever rode,&rdquo;
and then without another word he strode out of the
stable, his heart full of inexpressible bitterness.</p>

<p>For he knew that his own hand had killed the creature
he had loved. Brown Bess had been his favorite
horse, and had been given to him by his father shortly
before his death, and Henderson remembered at this
moment his pride and pleasure when he received the
gift.</p>

<p>And another memory, too, rose before him; a memory
fraught with remorse and shame, and the face of
the dead girl, Elsie Wray, seemed to hover near him in
the darkness, as he had seen her in the days of her
early love. He had ridden Brown Bess to the Wayside
Inn shortly after his father had presented her to him,
for the purpose of showing Elsie his new possession.
And when he was leaving the girl had followed him
out of the house, and laid her dark head against the
mare&rsquo;s glossy neck and kissed her.</p>

<p>He saw this little scene again now, and groaned
aloud in his misery. He had killed them both, he was
thinking&mdash;the two who had loved him&mdash;and bitter
and unavailing regret and remorse filled his heart.
His mad passion for May Churchill had blinded him to
all sense of justice and right, and he had flung away
the love which was truly his for the sake of a fair face
that had always looked coldly at him.</p>

<p>And now it all came back to him! Elsie&rsquo;s vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
appeals and awful death, and he shuddered as he
walked on; shuddered and stumbled amid his haunting
visions of the past.</p>

<p>A pale-faced woman was standing, candle in hand,
watching for him as he staggered toward the open
door of Stourton Grange. This was his mother, who
had grown uneasy at his prolonged absence, and was
now peering into the mist and darkness looking for her
only son. Presently she saw him; saw his haggard
face, and his eyes full of remorse and gloom. She
went forward to meet him; she took his cold, damp
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, are you not well?&rdquo; she said, tenderly, as
she led him into the hall, and put her candle down on
the table. &ldquo;You look ill, Tom, what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment he looked at her, and then suddenly
broke down, and a choking sob burst from his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, come in here; I&rsquo;ve a fire here,&rdquo; went on Mrs.
Henderson, putting her hand through his arm and leading
him into the drawing-room. She made him sit by
the fire; she got him what he required, and hung over
him and tended him with her mother&rsquo;s love strong in
her breast, as though he had been the sinless child
she had once cradled there.</p>

<p>She asked no questions, but presently she gathered
from his half-incoherent words that Brown Bess was
dead, and that he was weary of his life. She soothed
and comforted him, and finally persuaded him to go to
bed, but she did not leave him that night, nor for many
nights to come.</p>

<p>Either the shock he had received, or some subtle
poison floating in the damp, dank air, had struck him
down, but before the morning he was in a high fever.
And with extraordinary courage and devotion Mrs. Henderson
nursed him alone. She sent for no doctor; she
sought no help. She knew she was risking his life by
doing this, but she knew also that his babbling tongue
might reveal the dark secret of which she was only too
sure. So no ears but hers heard the ghastly details of
the tragedy on the ridge above Fern Dene.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Over and over again in the still hours of the night he
related the grim story. Sometimes he fancied Elsie
was standing by and would entreat her to take away
her dying curse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean it, Elsie! on my soul I did not!&rdquo; he
more than once cried, and his miserable watcher fell on
her knees and prayed to God that his words might be
true.</p>

<p>But it was a terrible time. Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s thick
brown hair grew gray, and her once comely face lined
and haggard. She let it be understood in the household
&ldquo;that the young master&rdquo; was suffering from
delirium tremens, and as Henderson was known to
have been drinking heavily lately, this account of his
illness was universally believed.</p>

<p>The groom, Jack Reid, went up to the house each
morning to ask after him, but he made no attempt to
see his master. The events of the night on which
Brown Bess had died seemed to have had a sobering
effect on this man. For in his own mind Reid now
never doubted that Henderson had intended to kill
him when by mischance he killed the horse. Their
frequent quarrels, and something in Henderson&rsquo;s lowering
looks when he had proposed to borrow the
dog-cart and Brown Bess, had rather alarmed Reid
at the time, and for this reason he had purposely
delayed his return home until he thought his master
would be absent at Captain North&rsquo;s supper party.</p>

<p>Then, when Henderson had gone into the stable, and
flung himself in his grief down by his dying horse,
Reid had seen the muzzle of a revolver suddenly
appear from one of the pockets of his overcoat. It
instantly struck the man at this moment who had shot
Brown Bess. The bullet intended for himself had
destroyed the animal that Henderson loved best, and
Reid gave a little shudder when he thought of his own
narrow escape.</p>

<p>But he said nothing of his suspicions. But a day or
so afterward he walked over to Captain North&rsquo;s place,
and after telling some of the men about the stables of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
his master&rsquo;s illness, he casually inquired what time the
&ldquo;young squire&rdquo; had arrived at Newstead on the night
of the Captain&rsquo;s supper party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Late,&rdquo; was the reply he received. &ldquo;Nearly an hour
later than the other gents. It wouldn&rsquo;t be less than a
quarter to ten o&rsquo;clock when he came, and he had a
strange sort of look when he did. Ay, it was the d. t.
coming on, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This answer satisfied Reid that he had not been mistaken.
Henderson had had time then to reach Newstead
after he had fired the shot in Henley Wood that
had killed Brown Bess. And the idea frightened Reid.
He had not, in fact, believed Henderson before capable
of deliberate murder. He knew he had not gone to the
ridge above Fern Dene intending to shoot poor Elsie
Wray. The girl&rsquo;s threats and taunts had maddened
him, and in a moment of uncontrollable passion he had
killed her. But this attempt on Reid&rsquo;s own life was a
very different affair. It showed the man that he had
to deal with a stronger and more savage and vindictive
nature than he had expected. He had bullied and
traded on Henderson&rsquo;s secret, never supposing that he
dare attempt to throw off the yoke. But he had gone
too far, and Reid now admitted this to himself, and
determined to be more careful and more prudent in
the future.</p>

<p>But Henderson was ill for many days, and it was
weeks after Brown Bess&rsquo; death that Reid first saw his
master. They met in the avenue by chance, while
Henderson was walking with his mother, and leaning
on her arm, for his strength was completely shattered.
The faces of both men flushed when they saw each
other, but Reid respectfully touched his hat as he
approached the mother and son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you are feeling better, sir?&rdquo; he asked, and
for a moment he stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am better,&rdquo; answered Henderson, briefly, and
he scowled and walked on, but there was a look in his
sunken eyes that Reid did not care to see.</p>

<p>Henderson, in fact, still nourished the bitterest animosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
against the man who held his secret, and who
had treated him with such insolence and disrespect.
Nor as his health returned did he forget the loss of
Brown Bess. He blamed Reid for this, and hated the
groom with a deadly hatred that grew and grew.</p>

<p>And during the days of his convalescence a letter
came to him which did not tend to make him any happier.
It was from Mrs. Temple, but was of a very
vague and unsatisfactory nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear you have been ill,&rdquo; it began,
&ldquo;but the address we talked of was not forthcoming, so
I could not send it. J. T. wrote to his uncle certainly,
but the sole address he gave was Paris, and moreover
he said he was leaving that city next day. I can not
help thinking it looks suspicious, but on his return we
may learn more, as he mentions that in another week
or so he would arrive at Woodlea. If I hear anything
I will let you know; in the meanwhile perhaps you had
best not come here. Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;R. T.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<small>THE BRIDE.</small></h2>


<p>Miss Webster was agreeably surprised when she
received her nephew Ralph&rsquo;s answer to her letter in
which she had told him of May Churchill&rsquo;s marriage.</p>

<p>It was a quiet, ordinary letter, and mentioned that
affair in the most commonplace manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Aunt Margaret,&rdquo; Miss Webster read with a
considerable feeling of relief. &ldquo;I received your letter
telling me of the marriage of your pretty young friend,
and I am sure we will all join in wishing her every
happiness. But what I don&rsquo;t quite like about the matter
is its secrecy. A secret marriage is, I think, always
unfair to the woman; and I understood from you that
this Mr. Temple was his uncle&rsquo;s heir, by the will of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
grandfather, in the event of the elder Mr. Temple leaving
no children. Now, if this is so, why should your
Mr. Temple be afraid of his uncle, and prefer to cast a
slur on the woman he has married, when his uncle can
really (I presume) eventually do him no harm? However,
it is no affair of ours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The weather here has been all that we could desire,
and if I was not afraid of boring you with the oft-told
description of Alpine scenery, I could tell you of some
wonderful bits of coloring from the effect of the sunshine
on the snow. However, as I hope soon to see
you, I will not write a long letter to-day. In another
fortnight I must be back to town, and hard at work at
the old grind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With love to yourself and Aunt Eliza,</p>

<p class="signoff">&ldquo;Yours affectionately,</p>

<p class="right">&rdquo;<span class="smcap">Ralph Webster</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Webster silently put this letter into her sister
Eliza&rsquo;s hand, and after Miss Eliza had read it she
returned it with one of her usual gentle sighs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear boy!&rdquo; she said, and that was all. Still both
the sisters felt relieved, and were glad to think no great
harm had been done. The way in which Ralph had
taken the news in fact made it easier for them to
answer their other letters which they had received
from the bride and bridegroom. In his, John Temple
asked Miss Webster very kindly to look out for a suitably
furnished house in their neighborhood for May.
This Miss Webster had done, but she could not hear of
one that was to be let at once. There was a house in
the same terrace, but it would not be vacant for two
months. Could Mrs. John Temple wait that long,
Miss Webster had inquired.</p>

<p>To this John answered no. He could not be absent
longer from England than another fortnight, and he
must see May settled in town before he left her. Again
the sisters went out house-hunting, but were still
unsuccessful. At last, half-nervously, Miss Webster
proposed to Miss Eliza to ask May to come to them
until she could see about a house for herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought about that, too,&rdquo; answered Miss
Eliza; &ldquo;but I did not like to suggest it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems so unkind,&rdquo; said Miss Webster, &ldquo;when her
room is standing empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The offer was therefore made, and was gratefully
accepted both by John Temple and May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is more than good of you,&rdquo; wrote John, &ldquo;but I
will leave May to thank you herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May&rsquo;s letter was a pretty bride-like epistle, in which
&ldquo;dear John&rsquo;s&rdquo; name occurred and re-occurred in every
other line. &ldquo;I am quite, quite happy,&rdquo; she wrote;
&ldquo;but how could I be otherwise when dear John is so
good to me, and when I am with him, for that alone
means happiness to me. We wander together about
this wonderful city, and dear John shows me beautiful
things of which I had never dreamed, and which but
for him I should have never seen. I tell him he is like
some prince in the fairy tales, who found his poor little
country sweetheart in the green woods. I feel so
unworthy of him, but he will never listen to this, and
his generous, noble words are very dear and sweet to
my heart. I will tell you some day what he says on
the subject, though I know it is only his great goodness
that makes him speak thus. Still he says I make him
very happy, and I pray to God night and day that I
may always be able to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweet young creature!&rdquo; said Miss Eliza, wiping
away a tear as she read these tender, loving words.</p>

<p>Miss Webster also was not unmoved. But when
Ralph Webster arrived they did not show him May&rsquo;s
letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is very happy,&rdquo; Miss Webster said, gently, and
then for the first time she noticed the change in her
nephew&rsquo;s appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Ralph!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and then paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are looking at my gray hairs,&rdquo; said Ralph,
quietly. &ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it funny? It must have been the
air of Switzerland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Webster said nothing, but she thought the
more. Not only had the air of Switzerland sown many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
white hairs round Ralph Webster&rsquo;s broad brow, but it
had visibly lined and aged his face. He, in fact, was
looking ill, and not like a man who had just returned
from his holiday.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to get back to my work,&rdquo; he said, and he
was. Work was good for him, and his strong, firm
mind recognized this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he said, presently, &ldquo;when do the bride and
bridegroom return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Miss Webster and Aunt Eliza told their little
story. They had tried in vain to find a suitable house
for Mrs. John Temple at the time she required one, as
Mr. John Temple was obliged to be back in England
almost immediately. But they had heard of a house
that would be vacant in two months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, dear Ralph, we thought we could not help
offering her a home here until she finds one to suit
herself,&rdquo; explained Miss Webster. &ldquo;And we expect
her to arrive the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dusky flush rose to Ralph Webster&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day after to-morrow?&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and&mdash;Mr.
Temple?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Mr. Temple will not stay here at all, dear, at
present. He proposes to bring his bride here on
Thursday afternoon, and he will stay to dinner, and
then start for the Midlands by the night train. You
must come to dinner on Thursday, Ralph, to meet him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Ralph shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have a case to work up on Thursday
which will take me until the small hours of the
morning. Besides,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;it would not do, you
know, for me to meet them, as I am not supposed to
know that they are married at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I forgot that,&rdquo; replied Miss Webster, nervously.
&ldquo;Dear me, dear me; these secret marriages are very
trying!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will look in on Friday,&rdquo; continued Ralph
Webster, &ldquo;and by that time you must find out how I
am to address her&mdash;by her maiden or her married
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>This was a complication that poor Aunt Margaret had
never reckoned on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must find out,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we must ask Mr.
John Temple; really it is very awkward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when Thursday arrived, and the sisters saw the
bride&rsquo;s sweet, happy face, they forgot at first to make
any inquiries on the subject. May was looking quite
charming; her dress, her beauty, even her manner was
improved. She was indeed a lovely young woman that
the kindly sisters took in their thin arms, and pressed
their faded lips against her rosy ones. As for John
Temple, he also looked exceedingly well, and his gray
eyes rested again and again on the beautiful face of his
fair bride with unmistakable affection.</p>

<p>He remained to dinner at Pembridge Terrace, but
explained how he was obliged to start on his journey to
Woodlea Hall almost immediately afterward. May knew
this, but her face saddened a little when John repeated
it, and her lips quivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle would never forgive me if I disappointed
him,&rdquo; said John, and then the little party began talking
of other things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is Mr. Webster?&rdquo; presently asked May.
&ldquo;Has he returned from abroad yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This question at once reminded the sisters of their
nephew&rsquo;s wish to know by what name he should address
May, and they looked at each other significantly; and
then Miss Webster&mdash;the stronger minded of the two&mdash;after
a little nervous hesitation spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has returned, and is very well,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;and&mdash;oh! my dear Mrs. John Temple, there is something
I wish to ask you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; answered May, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see it is rather awkward&mdash;but&mdash;but I
believe it was your wish, and&mdash;your husband&rsquo;s for your
marriage at present to be kept a secret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said John Temple, rather quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;my nephew knew Miss Churchill, you know,
Mr. Temple, before her marriage, and when he meets
her again&mdash;&rdquo; hesitated Miss Webster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He had better know her as Miss Churchill still,&rdquo;
answered John, gravely. &ldquo;For both our sakes, Miss
Webster, for the present our marriage must be kept an
absolute secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Webster stirred uneasily, and May blushed
deeply, and also made a slight restless movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is absolutely necessary,&rdquo; repeated John; &ldquo;but if
you wish, May, that Miss Webster&rsquo;s friends should
know you are married, why not take another
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will talk of it afterward,&rdquo; said May, gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear,&rdquo; he answered, and he looked at his
watch as he spoke, &ldquo;we shall not have very long to talk
of anything this evening. I must go upstairs and look
after my traps, if Miss Webster will excuse me, for the
cab I ordered will be here in half an hour. You had
better come with me, May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the two left the room together, and when they
were alone John put his arm around May&rsquo;s waist and
drew her to his breast and kissed her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know this must seem hard to you, darling, about
the name&mdash;and having to part so soon&mdash;but you see,
it would never do to offend my uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, no, John!&rdquo; replied May, fondly, and she
flung her arms round his neck as she spoke. &ldquo;Do you
think I would wish to do you any harm? You who have
been so good to me, and married me when I was so different
in every way to you? Of course, your uncle naturally
would resent your marriage to me, but the only
thing is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I should rather be known to be married
among Miss Webster&rsquo;s friends; you see when people are
not married&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young men are rather apt to fall in love with a very
pretty girl, eh, May? Is that what you mean? Well,
darling, perhaps you are right; call yourself Mrs. Somebody-else&mdash;or
no, a brilliant idea has struck me; call
yourself Mrs. John!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that will do!&rdquo; cried May, smiling. &ldquo;Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
John! that is charming&mdash;then I will bear John&rsquo;s name
still&mdash;my own John!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nestled closer to him, and John Temple murmured
something about &ldquo;being unworthy,&rdquo; of which
May took no heed. Then in wifelike fashion, she began
packing what he required, and he stood watching her
with a strange dimness in his eyes, which, however, May
did not see. She was thinking all the time how good
and noble he was; how he had risked his inheritance
for her sake; for May did not know that the Woodlea
estates were in truth strictly entailed on John Temple,
in the event of the present owner, Mr. Philip Temple,
leaving no children. She might have heard this at the
time of young Phil Temple&rsquo;s death, but girl&rsquo;s ideas on
such subjects are very vague. But she knew John&rsquo;s
marriage with her would offend his uncle, and therefore
it behooved her for his sake to keep it a secret as long
as his uncle lived.</p>

<p>By and by they heard a cab stop at the house-door,
and the bell rang, and they knew their parting hour had
come. May clung to John, and her eyes were wet with
tears when they went down-stairs together, and a few
minutes later he was gone! And a great blank seemed
suddenly to fall on the heart of the poor young bride.</p>

<p>But she tried not to show this, and presently said she
was tired with her journey, and asked Miss Webster&rsquo;s
leave to retire to bed. She kissed both the sisters
before she left them, and thanked them in her pretty
way for giving her for the present the shelter of their
roof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Miss Webster,&rdquo; she said, still holding Miss
Webster&rsquo;s kindly hand, &ldquo;I talked over the name with
John&mdash;I mean the name I am to be called by&mdash;and we
fixed on Mrs. John. You see there is nothing extraordinary
in that, and it is still John&rsquo;s name. I can not
take his full name on account of his uncle, as we must
run no risks; but I will be Mrs. John. Do you think
you can remember Mrs. John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, I can remember,&rdquo; answered Miss
Webster, and she kissed May&rsquo;s fair face again. &ldquo;And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
it is better that you should be known as a married
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; said May, and then she left the sisters
and retired to her own room to think there and pray for
John with all her heart.</p>

<p>The next day, of course, she wished to write to John,
but he had told her not to do so unless Miss Webster
directed her letter. And it seemed almost too soon to
ask Miss Webster to do this. Still she wrote, telling
him all her sweet thoughts, and prattling to him on
paper as she had done when nestling by his side. This
letter would be sent the next day, she decided, after she
had added this and that to it. Then after lunch she
went out to walk with Miss Eliza, and when they
returned they found Ralph Webster sitting in the dining-room
with his Aunt Margaret.</p>

<p>Miss Webster had by this time told Ralph Webster
that it had been decided that their young guest had for
the present to bear the name of &ldquo;Mrs. John.&rdquo; Ralph
had listened in somewhat grim silence, and when May
and Aunt Eliza appeared Miss Webster rose in a little
flurry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mrs. John, Ralph,&rdquo; she said, hastily.</p>

<p>Ralph Webster rose quietly and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, Mrs. John?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hear I have
to congratulate you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered May, with a charming blush, taking
his hand; &ldquo;I have been married since I saw you last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So my aunt has been telling me. Well, I did not
forget the edelweiss, and have three separate packets of
it at this moment in my coat pocket which is hanging
in the hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May had forgotten about the edelweiss. But she did
not tell Mr. Webster this, and accepted her portion of
the ice-flower smilingly. She thought he looked graver
and older, but supposed he had been working very
hard. She said something about this after dinner in
the drawing-room, and Ralph Webster admitted it was
true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have rather an important case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
coming on to-morrow, and have been burning the midnight
oil over it. And as it is about jewelry I suppose
it would interest you ladies. I do not know whether
you have ever heard of Miss Kathleen Weir, the
actress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>May, to whom he addressed this question, shook her
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An actress?&rdquo; echoed Miss Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I am told a very fascinating and handsome
young woman. But I shall see her to-morrow, as
I am junior in the case, and have to examine the witnesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you for the prosecution or the defense?&rdquo;
asked May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the prosecution. It is, in fact, rather a remarkable
case. It seems Miss Kathleen Weir is a lady who
owns a great number of diamonds, or rather, supposed
she did. Well, a month or so ago she was either hard
up, or she had a mind to change some of her diamonds
for something else. At all events, she took what she
supposed to be a valuable diamond brooch and earrings
to the jeweler, of whom they had been purchased, for
the purpose of disposing of them. The jeweler and his
assistants examined the stones, and told her they were
everyone paste&mdash;not diamonds at all in fact. The
cases were theirs, and the settings, but the diamonds
had been removed and replaced by false ones. They
at first supposed Miss Weir had wished to impose on
them, but the rage she flew into soon satisfied them
that this was not the case. She entreated one of the
jewelers to return with her to her flat to examine the
rest of her diamonds. A nice discovery awaited her;
half, nay more than half, were gone, and paste diamonds
had been substituted in place of the real ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a dreadful thing!&rdquo; exclaimed May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreadful for Miss Weir at least. These diamonds
were worth thousands of pounds, and someone must
have stolen them. The question was who did it, and
the affair had been in the hands of the detectives ever
since. Now they have got hold of someone, and Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Weir&rsquo;s confidential maid, a certain Miss Margaret Johnstone,
has to be put on her trial to-morrow for robbing
her mistress. I am told there is a strong defense, but I
think we hold the trump card.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be interested in the result,&rdquo; said May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half the women in London will be interested.
There is, I believe, an extraordinary fascination in
jewels to your sex, and in diamonds in particular.
However, by this time to-morrow Miss Margaret Johnstone
will probably know this to her cost. But now I
must go; I have my notes to look up on the case. Good-night,
Mrs. John; good-night, Aunt Margaret and Aunt
Eliza.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left the house a few moments later, after his aunts
had pressed him to return the following evening to tell
the news about the trial. And he did this, entering the
drawing-room at Pembridge Terrace the next night
about nine o&rsquo;clock with a slight flush on his somewhat
haggard face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, quietly, but still with the air of a
man who has gained something he had fought for, &ldquo;we
have won our case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do tell us all about it, dear!&rdquo; cried his aunts in
chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it bore you?&rdquo; asked Ralph Webster, looking at
May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, it will not,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will make it as short as possible, then. The case
of the prosecution was simple enough so far. Miss
Kathleen Weir discovered that more than half her diamonds
had been stolen and false ones substituted. She
discovered this, as I told you, by taking some of them
to a jeweler&rsquo;s to dispose of&mdash;the defense made a point
of this, as you will hear. Well, Miss Weir gave evidence
that no one ever went into her jewel-case but her
confidential maid, Margaret Johnstone. This woman
had been in her service five years, and she completely
trusted her. She admitted she sometimes left money
lying about, but it was never touched. Margaret Johnstone
used to take off Miss Weir&rsquo;s jewels on her return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
from the theater, and restore them to the case, and bring
them out the next day when they were required. Generally
Miss Weir carried the key of her jewel-case with
her, but sometimes she forgot it, and she remembered
one night in particular Margaret Johnstone telling her
she had done this. No suspicion, however, entered her
mind as regards her maid. But no one else had access
to the jewels, and when she discovered her loss she
naturally told her story to the police, and Margaret
Johnstone was arrested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The defense was peculiar. Margaret Johnstone
admitted taking Miss Weir&rsquo;s diamonds to a certain
somewhat contraband diamond dealer, but by her mistress&rsquo;
orders. This diamond dealer gave evidence. The
woman on trial had from time to time brought
diamond ornaments to him for sale. He was suspicious
at first, he said, but Margaret Johnstone gave
distinct answers. The diamonds belonged to her mistress,
Miss Kathleen Weir, the actress, and she was
short of ready money, and wished to sell the diamonds
for the best price she could get, and have false diamonds
substituted in their place in the same settings.
He still hesitated, and requested the maid to bring a
letter from her mistress authorizing him to carry out
this project. This Margaret Johnstone did, and the
dealer produced the letter in court, which Miss Weir
swore was never written by her, but the handwriting
slightly resembled her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After this constant transactions took place between
the diamond dealer and the maid. The dealer swore
that he had paid thousands to Margaret Johnstone and
received receipts for the money signed Kathleen Weir.
He swore also he never doubted that he was dealing
with the real owner of the jewels. &lsquo;Many ladies,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;did the same thing, and the diamonds their husbands
and friends gave them at their marriage were
frequently exchanged in after years for fictitious ones.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the counsel for the defense pointed out that
Miss Weir herself admitted she was going to try to dispose
of some of her diamonds when the so-called fraud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
was discovered. This looked as though she was in the
habit of doing so, and so on. This was the defense, but
of course I have not told it in legal language. All the
time, however, as I told you yesterday, I was sure we
held the trump card, which was that in one of the
woman&rsquo;s boxes, after she was arrested, a half-finished
letter was found. It was to a lover in Australia, asking
him if he had received safely the eight hundred pounds
she had forwarded to him by the last mail. &lsquo;She will
never be the wiser,&rsquo; Margaret Johnstone had written to
the lover, &lsquo;and the paste do quite as well for her as
the real.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The handwriting of this letter, and the letter signed
Kathleen Weir, held by the diamond dealer, and the
receipts also signed Kathleen Weir, were then submitted
to experts. These men decided they were
all really written by the same person. To make a long
story short, Margaret Johnstone totally broke down
under cross-examination, and began crying hysterically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It was the devil tempted me!&rsquo; she finally cried,
and so no doubt it was, but he played her a scurvy
trick, for she got a sentence of eight years&rsquo; penal servitude
for listening to his voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! poor creature!&rdquo; said May, pitifully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sympathies, I confess, lie with Miss Kathleen
Weir,&rdquo; continued Ralph Webster, smiling. &ldquo;She has
lost her diamonds, worth thousands of pounds, which
she will never see again, and she might have had a very
awkward reflection cast on her honesty. But I admit I
am prejudiced in her favor, for just before I started to
come here a note in the prettiest language imaginable
was handed to me from Miss Kathleen Weir. My
modesty forbade me to bring it, or to repeat all she had
written. But she paid me a great many compliments
on my &lsquo;masterly cross-examination&rsquo;&mdash;please remember
I am quoting&mdash;which, no doubt, she said, &lsquo;elicited the
truth from that wretched woman.&rsquo; And, moreover,
she wanted me to go to see her to-morrow afternoon,
and I mean to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ralph, to see an actress!&rdquo; said Miss Webster,
in dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do go,&rdquo; cried May, laughing. &ldquo;I am dying to
hear all about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said Ralph Webster, slowly, not knowing
that the hand of Fate was leading him into a pitfall
beset with doubt and anxieties from which there was
no escape.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<small>KATHLEEN WEIR.</small></h2>


<p>Ralph Webster did as he said he would, and went
on the following afternoon to call on the actress, Miss
Kathleen Weir.</p>

<p>She was expecting him, and her pretty flat was
charmingly arranged to receive him, and herself charmingly
dressed for the same purpose. She had admired
his strong, earnest, dark face in the court the day before,
and she was not in the least afraid of showing this. As
she rose to receive him&mdash;a tall, graceful, slender
woman&mdash;she held out a shapely white hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very much pleased that you have come to see
me, Mr. Webster,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, very much, for your kind permission to do
so,&rdquo; replied Ralph Webster.</p>

<p>She was really scarcely handsome, and yet she gave
you the impression that she was so. She had large,
restless gray eyes, and rather a pretty, piquant nose,
but her mouth was not good. It was too wide, and her
smile somewhat saucy and defiant. Yet altogether her
appearance was attractive, and many men, it was said,
had fallen victims to her charms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owe you a debt of gratitude,&rdquo; she went on in her
airy fashion, smiling on Ralph Webster; &ldquo;but for you
my character for honesty would be gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust not quite that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Weir held up her pretty white hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you had seen the senior Mr. Jordon&rsquo;s face
then, when I offered my poor paste diamonds for his
inspection, telling him how much the brooch and earrings
had cost. He looked, &lsquo;Woman, dare you attempt to
impose on me!&rsquo; if ever a man&rsquo;s thoughts were written
on his countenance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think they often are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. All our thoughts are written on our faces at
times, but I try to wear a mask when I can; do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Webster laughed a low, soft laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are forced to hide our thoughts and feelings
sometimes,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know I could imagine your doing that with
a very strong curb,&rdquo; went on Kathleen Weir, fixing her
large gray eyes on Webster&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I can fancy you
crushing down your strongest feelings and putting your
heel on them allegorically. You have a strong will
power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, you have! If you were in love with a
woman, and did not mean to tell her so, you would go
away from her, and not flutter around the flame like a
weaker man would do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose my wings were already singed?&rdquo; laughed
Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would bear the pain and still go. I envy your
strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are imagining it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! But here I am forgetting the duties of hospitality
to you on your first visit. What will you take;
tea, coffee, or some more masculine refreshment. They
are standing there in the inner room.&rdquo; And she pointed
to the draped archway between the two small drawing-rooms
as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I will not take anything,&rdquo; answered Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask if you wear a concealed bit of blue ribbon?
If you are a total abstainer, as I believe they call
themselves?&rdquo; smiled Kathleen Weir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can truthfully answer no,&rdquo; said Webster, also
smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have some champagne then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will have nothing, thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were we talking of? Ah, about being able
to conceal one&rsquo;s feelings. I can&rsquo;t; I wish I could; I
must speak my mind, and it&rsquo;s brought me no end of
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are clever enough, I am sure, to get out of
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not always; I had once to deal with a very peculiar
nature, or mine was peculiar perhaps&mdash;so he said&mdash;but
we could not pull together, and that brought me no
end of trouble&mdash;but I have got over it.&rdquo; And Miss
Weir shrugged her handsome shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You showed your wisdom,&rdquo; said Webster, a little
grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that; what is the use of grieving and fretting
and losing one&rsquo;s good looks for the sake of a person
who has ceased to care for one? Love is never rekindled,
you know; its ashes never again take fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you speak from experience?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Kathleen Weir, sharply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
watched the flame die out, and the last flicker expire.
It&rsquo;s an unpleasant experience, when the ice has not
already touched your own heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could never imagine it happening to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say that because I am an actress; a woman
used to, and who loves flattery, you are thinking. But
it did happen to me, Mr. Webster! Perhaps it was my
temper, perhaps it was his, but my gentleman turned
cold and disagreeable&mdash;and in the end we parted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Webster felt slightly embarrassed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, now,&rdquo; went on Miss Weir, throwing back her
well-shaped head, crowned with its thick chestnut hair,
&ldquo;he is no more to me than last year&rsquo;s snow! He
changed first, but I afterward. But why need I bore
you with all this? Perhaps you do know that I am a
married woman parted from my husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly did not know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, nine years ago I married a young man called
Temple&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Temple?&rdquo; interrupted Webster, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, John Temple; he was then a very young man,
studying for the bar, but he never practiced, for he had
some money, and he had no ambition. I think he
thought I had spoiled his life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A physical pain seemed to thrill through Webster&rsquo;s
heart, and he bit his lips to hide his emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;do you
never see him? What is he like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not seen him for these six years, but I know
he is still in the land of the living, and that I am not
entitled to a widow&rsquo;s cap, for each six months his lawyer
regularly sends me one hundred and fifty pounds. He
allows me, in fact, three hundred a year, and perfect
liberty. I do whatever I like.&rdquo; And Kathleen Weir
laughed a little bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you chose the stage?&rdquo; said Ralph Webster, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was on the stage when he had what I suppose he
calls the misfortune to marry me. He was a young fellow&mdash;barely
twenty-one&mdash;and I was three years older.
We lived together for about three years, principally
abroad, and then he tired of it. That is, he had been
tiring of it all the time; we did not pull together somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Webster drew a long breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is he like, I may have seen him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like? Good-looking, with gray eyes and a very
taking manner when he chose. But to me he was
often eminently disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you do not know where he is now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the very least; abroad most likely, for the
sunny south suited his pleasure-loving nature best. He
had no energy, and I hate men without it. Men are
born to fight in the battle of life, but John Temple
stood smiling at it; he will never succeed in anything,
and I love success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you have achieved it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as much as I wish, but I am fighting for it, and
will fight to the end. John Temple is a dreamer; but
we can not live in dreams. Had he been worth anything
his name would have been known now at the bar, as
yours is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo; hesitated Webster, &ldquo;you have heard nothing
of him lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word. But you seem interested? Have you
ever met him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; answered Webster. &ldquo;Do you know to
what family of Temples he belongs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not even tell you that. He told me he was
a younger son&rsquo;s son, I remember, and he was fairly
well off, and by no means given to extravagance,
though in his first ardor he actually gave me the
diamond earrings that so nearly got me into trouble&mdash;but
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is kind of you to say so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true; that woman Margaret Johnstone, who
was as brazen as brass, broke down under your cross-examination
like a reed with the strong wind. How
powerful you were! Every word told.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not flatter me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never flatter; but the truth is that you have
deservedly made a name, and will make a still greater
one. I shall swagger some day that my case was won
by the great Q. C., Sir Ralph Webster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Webster laughed, and a faint color stole to his
dark face, and then he rose to take his leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going so soon?&rdquo; said Kathleen Weir. &ldquo;Then I must
conclude you are tired of my company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please conclude nothing of the sort, but I am going
to dine with two very kind old aunts at Bayswater, and
I must not keep them waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; and Kathleen Weir held out her
white hand. &ldquo;I am coming out in a new piece to-morrow;
will you go and see me act, and then have supper
with me afterward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a most tempting invitation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is settled then, and now I will give you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
ticket, or tickets, whichever you like. But I warn you
not to bring the aunts, as the piece is a trifle fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still I should like to see it&mdash;and to see you act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you must say that!&rdquo; And Kathleen
Weir rose and laughed as she did so, and, having crossed
the room, she opened an inlaid cabinet, and brought out
some stall tickets and placed two in Webster&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One is for to-morrow; the other for Friday&mdash;and
good-by for the present; this has been your first visit to
me, but I trust it will not be your last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure it will not if you give me permission
to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do give you permission; you will always be welcome
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They shook hands and parted; and after Webster was
gone Kathleen Weir went to a mirror at one side of the
room and looked at herself attentively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he thinks me good-looking,&rdquo; she was
reflecting. &ldquo;What a clever face he has! He is a man I
think that a woman could be desperately in love with;
that she could give up everything for, though more
fool she! Luckily, I never fall in love, and I mean to
stick to this in spite of Mr. Webster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Ralph Webster had called a cab,
and was being driven to Pembridge Terrace in&mdash;for
him&mdash;a strange state of excitement. The story he
had just heard&mdash;the story of a wife forsaken by a John
Temple&mdash;had filled his mind with a sudden suspicion.
Could this be the John Temple who had married the
fair girl in secret, now living under his aunt&rsquo;s roof?
Was this the cause of his secrecy? This other wife,
of whom he had tired, had left to fight her own way in
the world. It seemed feasible, and if it were so, how
was he himself to act? Could he throw a bombshell
in this poor child&rsquo;s path, and in a moment destroy all
her happiness and hopes? But on the other hand&mdash;and
Webster frowned and bit his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be a cursed scoundrel if he has wronged
her so cruelly,&rdquo; he muttered, and he determined during
the evening to obtain from his aunts a complete personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
description of the John Temple who had married
May Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt Miss Weir has some portrait of her lost
husband,&rdquo; he thought a little scornfully; &ldquo;but at all
events he did not break her heart. Her description of
a dead love was not bad. However, she is a woman I
could not love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman he could love was in Miss Webster&rsquo;s
drawing-room alone when he entered it, and as he did
so May held out her hand with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come to tell us all about your visit to the
pretty actress?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered a little grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is she very pretty? Does she look as well off
the stage as on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She looks very well off, at all events, and I have
never seen her on, but I am going to see her to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May laughed her sweet girlish laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is she nice?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How does she talk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you could call her nice. She talks in
a hard, worldly fashion, but she is clever. She puts
things in a quaint, original way that somehow has a
certain charm in it. No, nice is not the word for Miss
Kathleen Weir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did she talk about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She discoursed on the folly of loving anyone if
they had ceased to love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rose-bloom deepened on May&rsquo;s cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she hesitated, &ldquo;if&mdash;if you had really loved
anyone I do not think you could cease to love them
because they had tired of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you really think,&rdquo; went on Ralph Webster with
a ring of pain in his voice, and with his dark, searching
eyes fixed on May&rsquo;s fair face, &ldquo;that if you had cared for
anyone and found out they were unworthy, that you
would not change?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think love can not change,&rdquo; answered May in a
low tone, and Ralph Webster suppressed a sigh as she
spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; he said, slowly, but at this moment
Aunt Eliza entered the room, and hurried up to him
with her kind welcoming hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Ralph,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I did not know you
were here, or I should have been down before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been hearing all about Miss Kathleen Weir,
the actress, Miss Eliza,&rdquo; said May, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! my dear&mdash;well, it may be an old-fashioned
prejudice, I dare say it is&mdash;but I do not like actresses,&rdquo;
sighed Miss Eliza.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a matter of training,&rdquo; said Ralph Webster;
&ldquo;fancy Aunt Eliza on the stage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ralph, how can you say such things?&rdquo; said Miss
Eliza, reproachfully.</p>

<p>Ralph Webster laughed, and then the conversation
changed. But before he left Pembridge Terrace for
the night he took an opportunity of speaking to Miss
Margaret Webster alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Margaret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is Mr. John Temple
like who married your pretty guest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-looking; yes, I should say very good-looking
indeed,&rdquo; answered Miss Webster; &ldquo;he has such a pleasant
expression, and nice gray eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gray eyes,&rdquo; repeated Webster, thoughtfully; he was
remembering Miss Kathleen Weir&rsquo;s description of her
husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, gray eyes with dark lashes. But Ralph, my
dear, if you would like to see it, I have a photograph
of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see it,&rdquo; answered her nephew; and
Miss Webster at once rose and produced her old-fashioned
photograph book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is our dear father,&rdquo; she said, turning to one
page, and pointing out a mild-faced old gentleman in
clerical garb; &ldquo;and this, Ralph, is your dear father&mdash;ah!
looking at this book always makes me a little sad,
and brings back old times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ralph Webster, glancing somewhat
impatiently at his grandfather and father; &ldquo;but where
is this wonderful Mr. Temple?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Webster then turned over several more pages
of her book; pages where she and Miss Eliza were
represented as young girls, then as young women in
costumes of other days. Finally, she pointed to the
smiling, good-looking face of a young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. John Temple,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and is exactly
like what he was when&mdash;he resided here; but he looks
rather older now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is certainly good-looking,&rdquo; answered Webster,
slowly, looking steadily at the face portrayed before
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt of that, and he has a very pleasant
manner, and one can not wonder at his young wife
being so much attached to him. There is only one thing
I do not like; that I can not approve of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that the marriage was a secret one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he made such a point of the secrecy. He
said for both their sakes it must not be mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he had good reason to keep it quiet,&rdquo; said
Ralph Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! my dear, I hope not! Only he is afraid of his
uncle&rsquo;s anger, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; and then Ralph Webster shook hands
with his aunt and went away; but as he walked down
the quiet street he made up his mind to make further
inquiries about Miss Kathleen Weir&rsquo;s husband.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH.</small></h2>


<p>The next evening, or rather in the early hours of
another day, four people were seated around the hospitable
board of Kathleen Weir. One of these was the
actress herself, her eyes bright with joy, her cheeks
flushed with excitement, for the new play had been a
great success, and the character of the heroine&mdash;passionate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
loving, and impulsive&mdash;had suited her, and had
won genuine applause from a crowded house. And
her three guests consisted of Ralph Webster, another
actress, and her present lover.</p>

<p>This other actress was of a very different type to
Kathleen Weir. If she had not been beautiful she
would have been nowhere on the stage. But she was
beautiful; a sleepy, languid beauty, with a skin of snow,
and shadowed dreamy eyes whose power she knew.
And seated near her at the round supper table was
young Lord Dereham, with his eyes fixed eagerly on
her face.</p>

<p>Lord Dereham&mdash;the Earl of Dereham&mdash;had only
very lately come into his great possessions. He was
rather good-looking, with an honest, open expression,
and the fair woman by his side had made up her mind,
in her cold-hearted, calculating way, that she would
become his wife. She was not in the least in love with
him, but she wished to be a countess, and have nothing
to do but amuse herself, and she was doing her best to
obtain these luxuries.</p>

<p>Her name was Linda Falconer&mdash;the lovely Falconer
the men called her&mdash;and her intended quarry at the
present moment was Robert, Lord Dereham. Kathleen
Weir had invited these two with a motive. She
knew Linda Falconer would devote herself to Dereham,
and that thus without being alone with Ralph Webster,
that she would virtually be so.</p>

<p>They had laughed and jested about the new play;
Kathleen, in her quick way and with her strong sense
of humor, had brightly related little incidents that had
occurred during the evening. She was not afraid of
Linda Falconer&rsquo;s white skin and dreamy eyes; she
knew Linda had no wit, and that her beauty was all
she had to depend on. Kathleen, on the other hand, had
many resources. She was handsome, or seemed so;
she was clever, and somehow she fancied that Ralph
Webster was not a man who cared only for charms
that were skin deep.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sprang to her feet in her lithe way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As all you good people seem to have finished supper,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;suppose we go into the other room and
I will sing you a song.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Webster at once rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am too weary to move,&rdquo; said Linda Falconer,
with a languid glance at Lord Dereham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are then, my dear,&rdquo; replied her
hostess; &ldquo;and you will still have the advantage of
listening to my warblings. Will you stay, too?&rdquo; And
she looked directly at Ralph Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go with you, if I may?&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>She smiled her saucy smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come then,&rdquo; she said, and the two passed together
through the draped archway that divided the two
rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How sentimental that young idiot looks,&rdquo; she
remarked as she opened the piano.</p>

<p>Webster smiled, and slightly shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his calf-love, I suppose,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From which he will speedily awake, if he does what
Linda Falconer means him to do. But what matter!
Yet, poor boy, I half pity him with his round, honest
brown eyes fixed on her face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a beautiful woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is,&rdquo; answered Kathleen, sharply, &ldquo;with a
heart of stone. There is no thought of human affection
in her; neither love nor hate. She means to marry
Dereham because he is Dereham, and I dare say she
will succeed. She holds the whip hand, you see, because
she gives him nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you call that holding the whip hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean the more a woman gives a man the less he
gives her. There, sir, that is my experience, and I
hope you will profit by it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will endeavor to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sneer; that expression does not suit your
face. You look best when you look earnest, and put
on what I call your fighting look. But I am forgetting
my song; stand here and turn over the leaves, and be
sure you do not turn two together.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Webster did as she bade him; he stood by her side
and arranged her music, and the next minute or so a
sweet flood of melody filled the room. Kathleen Weir
had a ringing voice; a voice that somehow kept you
spellbound until its last notes had died away. There
was a thrill of passion in it too, as if the singer&rsquo;s soul
were echoing her words. Webster leaned on the
piano, and drooped his eyelids listening, for these passion-swept
strains stirred a strange emotion in his own
breast. A flower-like face rose before his mental
vision, and he sighed restlessly, and Kathleen Weir,
glancing at him quickly, saw that she had touched
some hidden chord in his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man has loved someone once,&rdquo; thought the
keen-eyed woman, &ldquo;or&mdash;does my voice charm him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last thought pleased her best. Fuller and
sweeter became her song; brighter and more radiant
her eyes. But Webster was not looking at her. He
gave a little jerk and pulled himself together when it
was all over, and then for the first time since she had
commenced singing he remembered he was standing
by the side of Miss Kathleen Weir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you like that?&rdquo; she asked, softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I more than liked it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Miss Weir,
you have the voice of a siren, and could charm any
mariner down into the deep sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how about a landsman?&rdquo; she asked, archly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would ask mercy for a landsman, but would
advise him not to listen to your voice too often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;you do not wish to be charmed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I am already, it is too late for me to express
such a wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall sing you another song for making
such a pretty speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she sang again, but the two in the next room
remained where they were; the boy happy and
entranced, the woman calculating and cold. Then
Kathleen Weir tired of singing, and turned around on
her music-stool and talked to Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring a chair,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;and let us have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
chat&mdash;or no, I will sit on the rug; I am like a cat, and
love the warmth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was like a cat, also, in the extraordinary suppleness
of her limbs. She curled herself up now on the
soft, white rug before the fire, and leaned back on a
couch near, and fanned herself with a great feather fan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now tell me something of your life,&rdquo; she said,
looking up at Webster, who had drawn a chair toward
the fire also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What part of it?&rdquo; he asked, looking down smilingly
at the graceful woman before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all of it! Were you a good boy, or a bad boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Distinctly a bad boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a good man, or a bad man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had no time to be either; I am simply a working
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;how shall I put it? You are not married,
I presume?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor engaged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor engaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy man! You are free, then&mdash;absolutely free
to do what you like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have at least no one to control me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no one to control me, and yet I am not free,&rdquo;
said Kathleen Weir, half-bitterly. &ldquo;I think I ought to
look up that husband of mine, and see if he has not
given me good cause to get rid of him altogether.
What do you think, Mr. Webster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be only fair to yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am beginning to think so, too. There is the three
hundred a year to be considered, certainly, but I can
command a good income now. Yes&mdash;I should rather
be free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And would you marry again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo; And a wave of color rose to her
face. &ldquo;If I did I would not marry as Linda Falconer
wishes to do. I would not marry some titled boy for
the sake of his name; I would marry&mdash;well, a man
who has made his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You love ambition in men, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, distinctly yes! I should like to look up to the
man I married, not down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your present husband, Mr. Temple, like?&rdquo;
asked Webster, somewhat abruptly. &ldquo;Have you a
portrait of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I have, somewhere; as to looks he was all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I see his portrait? I may know him by sight;
I may help you to be free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kathleen Weir rose from her lowly position, and
crossing the room, opened an unlocked marquetry
cabinet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There used to be one here somewhere,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but I have not seen it for ages. The last time I saw
it I remember I turned its face to the wall. Ah, here
it is&mdash;yes, this is John Temple.&rdquo; And she shook a
little dust off the photograph as she spoke.</p>

<p>Webster eagerly crossed the room and took the
photograph from her hand. For a moment he did not
recognize the face; it was certainly not a copy of the
same photograph that Miss Webster had shown him.
It was a picture of a young man&mdash;almost a boy&mdash;but
as he closely scanned the features he became convinced
that the John Temple he was now gazing at was the
same John Temple who had married May Churchill.</p>

<p>He muttered something between his teeth which
made Kathleen Weir look quickly up in his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything of him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may; I don&rsquo;t quite know. Will you let me keep
this photograph for one day? I wish to compare it with
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep it forever, if you like. How strange if you
should know anything of John Temple!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many strange things in life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true; strange sympathies; strange hidden
ties. We are drawn to some people, are we not, and
repelled by others? We are wonderful creatures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Webster, slowly. He was scarcely
listening to her; he was still gazing at the photograph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
he held in his hand, and wondering how he ought to
act.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask you a question?&rdquo; he said, a moment
later, looking at Kathleen Weir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you may.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean in what church?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean in what place. Were you married in London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly; I was married in an old city church
called St. Jude&rsquo;s. We were married there because it
was out of the way, I suppose. John Temple chose
the church, and I went and lived a fortnight in the
parish before it took place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;forgive me&mdash;you cared for him then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; more fool I! But why do you ask all these
questions? You make me curious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment the curtain dividing the two rooms
moved, and the beautiful actress, Linda Falconer,
stepped between them, followed by her young lover.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have come to ask you for another song, Kate,&rdquo;
said Miss Falconer, languidly. &ldquo;Dereham, here, is
quite enchanted with your voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will not be enchanted any more to-night, then,&rdquo;
answered Kathleen Weir; &ldquo;this man and I,&rdquo; and she
nodded at Webster as she spoke, &ldquo;have been talking of
old times, and singing would seem frivolous after our
conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! I did not know you knew Mr. Webster long
ago.&rdquo; And Miss Falconer rested for a moment her
dreamy eyes on Webster&rsquo;s dark face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew him in some spirit-land, I believe,&rdquo; said
Kathleen, with a light laugh. &ldquo;I really feel as if I had
known you somewhere else, do you know, Mr. Webster.
Where can it have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In some spirit-land, perhaps, as you say,&rdquo; answered
Webster, with a smile. &ldquo;But I must go now, and may
I really take this photograph with me? I will return it
the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it by all means, and come to supper the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
after to-morrow. You may have something to tell me,&rdquo;
she added, significantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may; I can not tell. Good-night, Miss Weir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook hands with the others after this, and went
away carrying the photograph with him. He was now
almost convinced that the John Temple who had married
May Churchill was the same John Temple who
had married Kathleen Weir. If this were so May was
not his wife, and Kathleen was! Webster&rsquo;s dark face
flushed, and his heart beat faster as he thought of it.
But suddenly he remembered May&rsquo;s words about faithfulness
in love. Would she change even if she knew
the man she had married to be completely unworthy?
She might and she might not, and greatly disturbed in
mind Ralph Webster returned to his chambers, and
when he got there drew out the old photograph and
examined again the somewhat faded likeness of the
man he had never seen.</p>

<p>But the next morning brought him a letter, which
more surely confirmed his suspicions. This was from
Kathleen Weir herself, and the subject of it was her
husband, John Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Webster</span>,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;you had scarcely
gone to-night, when I heard something that has surprised
me greatly. It seems that Linda Falconer, in
the pleasant way that we all talk of our friends&rsquo; sins or
sorrows, had been telling Lord Dereham, when I was
singing to you, all about my unfortunate marriage, of
which he had never heard. When she mentioned John
Temple&rsquo;s name Dereham pricked up his ears. &lsquo;Is that
the man,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;who not long ago came into a fortune
by his young cousin being killed at football?&rsquo;
Now if this is my John Temple who has come into a
fortune, it is a very plain fact that he should increase my
allowance to something more respectable than a paltry
three hundred a year. And I want you to find out this
for me. I receive my income from him through a certain
Mr. Harrison, a solicitor, and I inclose Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s
address. Will you go to him and make inquiries?
I will think it most awfully good of you if you will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
and I shall be eternally grateful to you if I were not so
already! I am treating you as a friend, for I feel somehow
that you are one, and the thought is very pleasant
to me. Write after you have seen Harrison, and come
the day after to-morrow to supper.</p>

<p class="signoff">&ldquo;Yours most sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">&rdquo;<span class="smcap">Kathleen Weir</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no longer any doubt in Ralph Webster&rsquo;s
mind after he had read this letter as to the identity of
the John Temple who had married two women. But
there was a doubt; a strange vivid doubt as to how he
should act under such painful circumstances. Before
him rose the sweet, girlish face of May Churchill, with
her glad eyes and quiet happiness; and then he thought
of the change this cruel news would bring. The light
would fade from her eyes, and the color from her
smooth cheeks, and a crushing sense of shame and sorrow
overshadow her young life. He tried to put his
own feelings out of the question. The passionate beating
of his heart he would not listen to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must think what would be best for her,&rdquo; he told
himself; &ldquo;but at all events I will go and see Harrison,
and learn the whole story, as far as he knows of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison, the solicitor, was a personal acquaintance
of his own. He had given him a couple of briefs,
and they always exchanged friendly nods when they
met. He only needed some slight excuse to pay Harrison
a visit, and he soon found one on some point of
law which he affected not quite to understand.</p>

<p>The solicitor received him almost with effusion. He
was a little bustling man, and had a large business, and
a rising barrister was always a person of consideration
to him. He had not seen Webster since Kathleen
Weir&rsquo;s diamond case had been in court, and he quickly
proceeded to compliment Webster on the way he had
conducted the cross-examination of the maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, very good, very good indeed, Mr. Webster,&rdquo; he
said rubbing his hands together to express his satisfaction.
&ldquo;You tackled her splendidly, and it was a somewhat
awkward affair for the handsome actress unless it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
had been cleared up. Very good-looking woman Miss
Kathleen Weir, though of course, that isn&rsquo;t her real
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not?&rdquo; answered Webster, trying not to show
his eager interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no; there&rsquo;s a bit of romance connected with
Miss Weir&rsquo;s life that, strange to say, I&rsquo;ve been connected
with for some years. She&rsquo;s a married woman in fact;
married to a certain Mr. John Temple, who is a client
of ours; but they are separated by mutual consent, and
Mr. Temple allows her a fair income to live on, but,
of course, she does not need it; I am told she commands
high prices on the stage, but still it is only right that
Mr. John Temple should allow her something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. John Temple,&rdquo; repeated Webster, quietly; &ldquo;is
that the man who became heir to a large fortune not
long ago, by the death of his young cousin during a
game of football?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison nodded his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very man, Mr. Webster! Yes, Mr. John Temple
has been born under a lucky star I think. He is
now heir to his uncle Mr. Temple of Woodlea Hall, a
large land-owner, and a rich man to boot. But I have
not told Miss Kathleen Weir of this windfall; you see
she might be setting up claims that would annoy Mr.
John Temple; asking for a larger allowance perhaps, or
even to take his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To which I suppose she has a legal right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, unfortunately I fear so; nay it is so. In his hot
young days you see he was led away to hang a millstone
round his neck, just like many young men, and
now, no doubt, he bitterly repents it. Ah, it&rsquo;s a great
mistake&mdash;a great mistake when a young fellow marries
beneath him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt, but, Mr. Harrison, I am keeping you from
your work and must no longer detain you. Thank you
for answering my question, and now I must say good-morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Webster; very pleased to have
seen you,&rdquo; and the little man bustled about saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
many pleasant things. But Webster soon cut him short
and went away. He had learned all that Mr. Harrison
could tell him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

<small>A DISCOVERY.</small></h2>


<p>Women in general have a strong interest in jewels,
and in stories connected with them, and Mrs. Temple
of Woodlea was no exception to this rule. Thus the
day after Kathleen Weir&rsquo;s diamond case had been
decided she was reading it in the morning papers, when
her husband&rsquo;s nephew John Temple entered the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>He shook hands with her and then with his uncle in
his usual pleasant fashion, but had scarcely begun his
breakfast when Mrs. Temple commenced talking about
the actress&rsquo; diamonds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is such a strange case in the papers this
morning,&rdquo; she said, addressing John Temple; &ldquo;an
actress, Kathleen Weir, has had her diamonds stolen in
a most extraordinary manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple was in the act of helping himself to
some toast from the toast-rack as Mrs. Temple made
the remark, and for a moment his hand remained suspended,
and a dusky wave of color rose to his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Temple, quickly,
instantly noticing these signs of agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered John Temple, a little huskily, and
then he took the toast, but left it untasted on his plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they recovered the diamonds then?&rdquo; asked
the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not; her maid had taken them and
substituted false ones in the same settings. But here
is the account; you had better read it.&rdquo; And Mrs. Temple
handed the newspaper to her husband.</p>

<p>John Temple said nothing; he began slowly eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
his breakfast, but apparently without appetite, and then
he opened another newspaper and turned to the column
containing the trial of Margaret Johnstone for diamond
stealing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, a little scornfully, after he had read
it, &ldquo;this young lady, Miss Kathleen Weir, seemingly
was tired of some of her diamonds, and wished to dispose
of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she was tired of the man who gave them to
her?&rdquo; replied Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said John, with a little shrug of his
shoulders; &ldquo;of the poor fool who perhaps impoverished
himself to give her gauds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then perhaps also tired of her?&rdquo; retorted Mrs.
Temple.</p>

<p>Again John Temple shrugged his shoulders and sat
somewhat moodily glancing over the newspapers, while
his uncle&rsquo;s wife followed his movements with her handsome
dark eyes. He interested her, this good-looking
man who had taken her dead boy&rsquo;s place, and having
him at Woodlea made the house seem less dull. She
had a strong craving for excitement, and to her anything
was better than the wearisome company of her
old husband. And she could not understand John
Temple. He was always gentle and friendly in his
manner to her, but he was never confidential. And
this annoyed her. Unconsciously almost to herself she
was beginning to regard him with warmer feelings than
she would have cared to own. At all events she was
jealous of him, and half-believed that for his sake May
Churchill had left her home.</p>

<p>So when breakfast was over, and the squire after his
usual fashion had retired to his library, Mrs. Temple
went up to John, who was still reading the newspapers,
and lightly touched his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the truth were known, sir,&rdquo; she said, smiling, &ldquo;I
believe you could tell us something about Miss Kathleen
Weir&rsquo;s diamonds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again a flush rose to John Temple&rsquo;s face, but this
time it was an angry one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you say such a thing?&rdquo; he answered
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I was watching you when you first heard
of the robbery. Ah, my nephew John, I fear you are
not as good as you look.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a most brilliant imagination, my handsome
aunt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not call me by that odious name! But perhaps
I have more discernment than you give me credit for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave you credit for every good quality; discernment
among the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple nodded her head and stood by his side
looking down at his face. She saw he was more
annoyed than he cared to show. And she knew there
must be some cause for this, for as a rule John Temple
was very even tempered. But she did not say anything
more about the diamonds, and after a moment or two
she turned away, and John Temple was left to his own
reflections.</p>

<p>His expression changed after she left the room, and
he frowned, stirred uneasily, and once more read over
the evidence given at Miss Kathleen Weir&rsquo;s jewel case.
And a bitter look came over his face as he did so; a look
of contempt and scorn, and flinging down the newspaper
he went to the window of the room, and stood
looking out moodily at the wide park, which one day
would be his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have paid pretty heavily for a boy&rsquo;s folly,&rdquo; he
muttered, &ldquo;and some day, my sweet flower, it may fall
on you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this thought stung him sharply. He loved his
Mayflower, as he called her, with a true and passionate
love, and he would have given up almost anything for
her sake. Her beauty, her tenderness, and her devotion
to himself had entirely won his heart. Before he
had met May Churchill he had been almost indifferent
to the consequences of the &ldquo;boy&rsquo;s folly,&rdquo; which now
galled him so deeply. But he little guessed how near
the shadow of it was stealing across his path.</p>

<p>Yet this knowledge came to him only a day later after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the conversation about the actress&rsquo; demands had taken
place between himself and his uncle&rsquo;s wife. He went
down to breakfast on this particular morning rather
earlier than usual, but the letters and newspapers had
already arrived, and placed near his usual seat at the
table was a large letter directed in the now well-known
handwriting of Miss Webster.</p>

<p>He knew that this would contain an inclosure from
May, and so he quietly put the envelope into his pocket
without any comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More bills?&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple, looking at him with
a curious little smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid so,&rdquo; he answered, and his uncle glanced
up at him over his newspaper with some uneasiness in
his expression as he spoke.</p>

<p>John Temple, however, did not seem at all disconcerted.
He was always glad to hear from May, and the
very fact that he had a letter in his pocket from her
gave him a feeling of quiet happiness. He, therefore,
talked cheerfully during the rest of the meal, but as
soon as it was over he left the room, carrying his letters
away with him, and Mrs. Temple looked after him as
he went.</p>

<p>Let us follow him upstairs to the small suite of rooms
which had been set apart for him by his uncle&rsquo;s wish.
These consisted of a sitting-room where he smoked, a
bedroom adjoining, and a little ante-room which had a
stone balcony overlooking the park.</p>

<p>John Temple went into his sitting-room, which
opened from a corridor, and having pushed the door
nearly close behind him, he pulled out his letter and
began reading May&rsquo;s fond tender words with a smile.</p>

<p>Then suddenly his face darkened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have been all greatly interested,&rdquo; he read,
&ldquo;about a diamond robbery, which, I dare say, you have
seen in the newspapers. The maid of the popular and, I
believe, pretty actress, Miss Kathleen Weir, had stolen
her mistress&rsquo; diamonds and substituted false ones instead
of them. How we came to hear so much about it is
that Mr. Webster, the nephew of the Miss Websters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
was one of the barristers in the case for the prosecution
and Miss Kathleen Weir was so pleased by the way
Mr. Webster conducted it that she invited him to her
house. He says she is handsome and clever, but not
exactly what he calls &lsquo;nice.&rsquo; But all the same I think
he rather admires her, and their acquaintance seems to
progress, in spite of the alarm of his dear old aunts!
Did you ever see her? Some time when you are in
town&mdash;and when is that dear time to be?&mdash;you must
take me to see her act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple went on frowning as he read these innocent
words. Here was a mine under his feet indeed!
He knew the nature of Kathleen Weir; the outspoken
frank nature, that was just as likely as not to confide
her whole history to a stranger. What if she told of her
early marriage to this Webster, who might repeat it to
his aunts? He had warned the Misses Webster to
keep his marriage to May a secret, and May did not
bear his name. Still in some moment the old ladies
might reveal it to their nephew, and then no one could
tell where the mischief might end.</p>

<p>John Temple flung the letter on the table and began
walking restlessly up and down the room, thinking what
it would be best to do. &ldquo;She must leave Pembridge
Terrace at once,&rdquo; he decided. But then, how could this
be arranged? If he went up to town he might meet
Webster, and May was too young and girlish to go
about house-seeking alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That confounded woman,&rdquo; he thought bitterly of
Kathleen Weir, &ldquo;is forever in my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was full of impatience, chafing against fate and
the mad folly of his youth. The door of the bedroom
beyond was standing open, and farther still he could see
from the balcony window of the ante-room a green
patch of the park. He went into this ante-room, opened
the window and stepped out on the balcony, still cursing
his ill-luck. He did not see, as he leaned over the
balustrade, that someone had entered his sitting-room,
on the table of which the letter from May was lying open.</p>

<p>Yet this was so. Moved by curiosity, and a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
subtle feeling still, Mrs. Temple had followed him
upstairs, shortly after he had left the breakfast room.
She sometimes&mdash;not often&mdash;went into his sitting-room
if she had anything that she wished particularly to say
to him, and something prompted her to go into it now.
The door was very slightly ajar, and she pushed it open
and entered the room, and in a moment her eyes fell on
the open letter on the table.</p>

<p>She made a step forward and looked at it. Then she
read the words with which it commenced:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dearest, dearest John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her breath came fast, her heart beat quickly, and she
put out her hand as if to take it up, but glancing to the
open bedroom door she saw John Temple leaning on
the balustrade of the ante-room balcony beyond, and
her hand shrank back.</p>

<p>But again she looked at the letter; looked at the
address in Pembridge Terrace, which was neatly printed
on the paper. She noted this in an instant, but as she
did so John Temple turned his head, and Mrs. Temple
quickly moved back, and left the room, without his
having ever been conscious that she had been there.</p>

<p>But she had made a discovery; a discovery which
filled her heart with jealous anger. As she walked on
to her room she decided in her own mind that it was
the missing girl, May Churchill, who had addressed
John Temple as &ldquo;My dearest, dearest John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shameful!&rdquo; she thought, bitterly; &ldquo;absolutely
shameful; and what a liar he is, but his uncle shall
know&mdash;he shall bitterly repent the part he has played.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She walked up and down her room in a state of the
greatest excitement. It seemed to her as if John Temple
had done her some personal wrong, which he certainly
had not. She had allowed herself to be attracted
by him&mdash;to fill the waste in her heart&mdash;but he had
never for a moment forgotten she was his uncle&rsquo;s wife.
He had pitied her in her grief about her dead boy, and
his manner was always gentle and kindly to women,
but he did not even admire her; she was too excitable,
too uncertain in her temper, for his taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must bring it home to him,&rdquo; she now told herself;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use striking until I can bring it home&mdash;I
will send for young Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She accordingly sat down at her desk and began a
letter to Henderson. At first she thought of asking
him to the Hall, but afterward remembered that this
might look strange to her husband and John Temple.
No, she must meet him somewhere about the country,
and she paused, pen in hand, thinking where it should
be.</p>

<p>She decided in a few minutes, and then addressed the
following letter to Henderson:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Henderson</span>: Will you meet me to-morrow
in the lane that leads to the West Lodge, at half-past
three o&rsquo;clock? I shall be walking, as I do not wish
anyone to know of this appointment, and if I am not
there at the time I mention, it will only be that it is
absolutely impossible that I can manage to go. In that
case I will go on the following afternoon, at the same
time. At last I have something to tell you on the subject
we talked of before; it is almost a certainty this
time. In haste, yours very truly,</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">R. Temple</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took this letter with her own hands to the nearest
village post-office, not caring to place it among the
other letters in the post-bag lying on the hall table, and
as she was returning from her errand she encountered
John Temple on the road, who was also going to the
post office.</p>

<p>Her face flushed deeply as she met him, and a scarcely
repressible feeling of anger rose in her heart; while
John Temple, ignorant of the cause, looked at her with
his usually pleasant smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are taking a walk?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She hardly answered him. She was a very passionate
woman, and could not hide her feelings. She stood
looking at him, burning to accuse him of what she
deemed his treachery and deception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you,&rdquo; she said, presently, very bitterly,
&ldquo;carrying a letter to some hidden lady-love; a letter that
you do not wish the household to see?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>John Temple was conscious that he slightly changed
color.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are always accusing me of something or other,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I have good cause,&rdquo; she retorted, with such
marked emphasis that John Temple felt somewhat
uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I have always done my
best to avoid offending you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple deigned to make no reply. She gave a
little toss of her head and walked on her way, and John
went his, reflecting what a sad thing it was for a woman
to have a bad temper!</p>

<p>And all the rest of the day it was the same thing.
When Mrs. Temple spoke to him at all, it was either in
taunting or bitter words. Her husband even noticed
this, and asked why she spoke thus to his nephew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will soon learn,&rdquo; she answered, and the squire
said nothing more. He was accustomed to the changeful
temper of his handsome wife, but all the same he
was sorry that her manner had changed to John Temple.</p>

<p>And the next morning, at breakfast, John noticed
how restless she was. There was some disturbing element
in her mind he plainly saw, though he had no idea
it was caused by himself. He had, as we know, his own
anxieties and troubles, but he never dreamed of Mrs.
Temple&rsquo;s being connected with them.</p>

<p>In the meantime at Stourton Grange her letter had
caused the strongest excitement in young Henderson&rsquo;s
breast, for she had discovered something about May
Churchill, he told himself; something connected with
Temple, no doubt. He waited impatiently until the
time she had appointed to meet him came, and then
walked to the lane that led to the West Lodge at Woodlea
Hall. Here he waited nearly half an hour before
Mrs. Temple appeared. At last, however, he saw her,
and went eagerly forward to meet her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got my letter?&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple, as she shook
hands with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, this morning,&rdquo; answered Henderson, quickly,
and his brown face flushed as he spoke. &ldquo;You have
something to tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple gave a little scornful laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have discovered, I think, where the beauty that all
you men raved about is hidden; but I must be sure,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;You guess what I mean? A letter came
for John Temple yesterday morning&mdash;a passionate
love letter&mdash;from this address,&rdquo; and as she spoke she
drew out the address that she had seen on May&rsquo;s letter
to John, and placed it in Henderson&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I am
almost sure this letter was from Miss Churchill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see it?&rdquo; asked Henderson, eagerly, and
with quivering lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw the first lines of it. It was lying open on a
table in his room when I went in, and I have no doubt
it was from her. But I want you to find out this; to
go up to town and see this girl yourself&mdash;I mean to
watch the house until she comes out of it. Do not
speak to her or call upon her, or perhaps she would
again disappear. But if what I believe is true John
Temple shall bitterly repent the gross deception he has
practiced on us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henderson ground his strong white teeth together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you believe,&rdquo; he said, hoarsely, &ldquo;that&mdash;that
May Churchill&mdash;is anything to Temple?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe she is everything to him,&rdquo; she answered.
&ldquo;The letter I saw began, &lsquo;My dearest, dearest John.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fierce oath broke from Henderson&rsquo;s lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I believed he had wronged this girl&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may have married her,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Temple,
scornfully. &ldquo;At all events, if she wrote this letter
there is no doubt of the connection between them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some other woman may have written it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I want you to find out. Will you go
to town to learn the truth, and when?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go to-morrow; no, I will go to-night; I will
be at the bottom of this, and if it is as you think, Mr.
Temple will find his mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not act like a fool, and get into any trouble
about her. But find out, and then write to me at once
all particulars. If you see her, follow her at a distance,
and ask at the nearest shops what name she goes by.
Keep the address safe, and now good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not likely to lose the address,&rdquo; answered
Henderson, sullenly, as he placed it in his pocket-book.
&ldquo;Good-by, Mrs. Temple, I will let you know what I
find out, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do nothing until you have heard from me. Good-by;
I believe now you are on the right track.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />

<small>MRS. JOHN.</small></h2>


<p>Henderson parted from Mrs. Temple with every
nerve in his body throbbing with excitement. In spite
of May Churchill&rsquo;s rejection of his love, his unreasonable
passion for her remained unchanged. There were
times when he felt he hated her; when he cursed her
memory, and blamed her for the undying remorse that
overshadowed his soul. But for her, he often told himself,
the miserable girl who had loved him too well
might have been living still, and he himself free from
the galling chains held by his groom, Jack Reid.</p>

<p>But if he hated May, it was a sort of loving hatred,
while his feelings to John Temple were of the bitterest
description. He believed but that for Temple, May
would ultimately have become his wife; and as he
strode down the lane, after parting with Mrs. Temple,
he seemed to see again, in his mental vision, John lying
at May&rsquo;s feet in Fern Dene in the early days of their
first acquaintance.</p>

<p>And that he should have induced her to leave her
home; that she was writing to him in the terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
described by Mrs. Temple, positively seemed to madden
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it may be some other woman,&rdquo; he told himself,
as he had told Mrs. Temple. But at all events he
would find out, and on his return to the Grange, to his
mother&rsquo;s great surprise, and not a little alarm, he told
her he was about to start for London in a few hours.</p>

<p>Hidden anxiety and grief had wrought their baneful
work now on Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s face. The terrible
knowledge of her son&rsquo;s crime, the awful dread of its
punishment, were ever present in her mind. She had
grown old before her time, and watched Henderson
with unceasing eyes of fear.</p>

<p>Thus when she heard of his sudden journey she
could scarcely suppress her nervousness. Henderson,
too, was moody and reserved, and hurried on his preparations
for departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be long away?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a few days at most,&rdquo; he answered, and he told
the same story to his groom, Jack Reid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is something sudden,&rdquo; said Reid, looking at
him suspiciously. It crossed the man&rsquo;s mind, indeed,
that his master was about to leave Stourton for a much
longer time than he stated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back probably the day after to-morrow,&rdquo; said
Henderson, with affected carelessness; and Reid felt
he could say nothing more, for he had grown certainly
more respectful in his manner to his master after the
episode of the shooting of Brown Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man who would try his hand at that kind of thing
might do it again,&rdquo; self-argued the groom; and Reid
was not one who cared to be shot at if he could
help it.</p>

<p>So Henderson left Stourton, and having arrived in
town, he went for the night to an hotel, and the next
morning drove in the direction of the address which he
had received from Mrs. Temple. And Fate actually
favored him, for quitting his cab before he reached
Pembridge Terrace, he walked up the terrace, and after
passing Miss Webster&rsquo;s house for a few yards he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
back again, and as he did so he saw, in a moment,
descending the steps in front of the house a figure and
face that he only remembered too well.</p>

<p>It was May Churchill, and closely following her came
the prim, neat form of Miss Eliza Webster. They
opened the garden gate and then went on the street,
and Henderson was so near them that had May turned
her head she must have recognized him. But she was
smiling and talking to Miss Eliza, and never looked back,
but Henderson distinctly saw the face that had cost him
so dear. He paused a minute or two, and then slowly
followed the two ladies before him. They went on to
Westbourne Grove, and into a large bonnet and hat
shop at the corner of the street. Henderson lingered outside
at a little distance from the shop, and after waiting
about a quarter of an hour May and Miss Eliza once
more appeared, and turned their footsteps homeward.
Again Henderson followed them, his heart throbbing
violently and his eyes never leaving May&rsquo;s form. They
went straight back to the address Mrs. Temple had
given him, and Henderson now knew Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s
surmise had been correct. John Temple had persuaded
her to leave her home, and had hidden her
away, and Henderson could scarcely suppress the passionate
rage that swelled in his breast when he thought
of it.</p>

<p>He was tempted to go on; to speak to May, and
heap reproach on her head. But he knew he had no
right to do this. She might be John Temple&rsquo;s wife, for
anything he knew, and what good could his hard words
do? None, he felt. He might, he would, punish John
Temple, but what could he do to the girl? With a
curse between his bitten lips he turned away, and walking
back to the shop he had seen May and Miss Webster
enter and leave, he went in under the pretense of
buying a bonnet for his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a bonnet for an old lady,&rdquo; he said to a pretty,
smiling shopwoman, adding immediately afterward:
&ldquo;Who were the two ladies who have just been here&mdash;I
saw them go out&mdash;a young lady and an old one?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>The pretty shopgirl smiled pertly, and instantly
understood the motive of the purchase of the bonnet
for &ldquo;an old lady,&rdquo; by this handsome young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Mrs. John, I suppose, sir?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;She is a very handsome young lady, and it is astonishing
how many gentlemen admire her and ask about
her, but she is certainly very pretty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And does she live near here?&rdquo; inquired Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She lives in Pembridge Terrace with the Misses
Webster. She is a newly-married lady, but I believe
her husband is a good deal away. She is a customer of
ours, and is often in the shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And her name is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. John; rather a strange name, isn&rsquo;t it, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. John,&rdquo; repeated Henderson, beneath his breath,
but he did nothing more. He understood it all now;
she had run away with John Temple, and was called
Mrs. John, and he needed no further information.</p>

<p>He forgot all about the bonnet for his mother until
the shopwoman reminded him of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Choose what you like,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the lady is elderly&mdash;my
mother&mdash;and a widow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But does she wear a widow&rsquo;s bonnet, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; answered Henderson, indifferently.
&ldquo;Something dark and good&mdash;what will it cost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This matter was soon settled. The shopwoman
chose a bonnet, and Henderson paid for it, and then
drove back straight to his hotel. When he arrived
there he at once addressed the following letter to Mrs.
Temple:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Temple</span>: You were quite right. May
Churchill is living at the address you gave me in Pembridge
Terrace, and is called Mrs. John. I saw her
leave the house and go into a shop, accompanied by an
old woman. I went into the shop after they left it, and
one of the girls there told me that she&mdash;May&mdash;was a
Mrs. John, and that she was a newly-married woman,
which I greatly doubt. I shall return to Stourton
to-day, and go to-morrow morning with my news to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
Woodside Farm. May&rsquo;s father shall know how his
daughter has been treated. And I remain,</p>

<p class="signoff">&ldquo;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">&rdquo;<span class="smcap">T. Henderson</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This letter reached Woodlea Hall on the following
morning, and when the squire opened the letter-bag, as
was his wont, he rose and placed Henderson&rsquo;s letter in
his wife&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a letter from London for you, Rachel,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s handsome face flushed, and then grew
pale. She had not expected to hear for a few days, at
least, from Henderson, yet she knew this letter was
from him. She gave once glance of her dark eyes at
John Temple&rsquo;s face, who was sitting at his usual place
at the breakfast-table, and then without a word she rose
and left the room, carrying her letter in her hand.</p>

<p>But she was scarcely outside the door when she
opened it. She read it in the hall, and a hard and bitter
look came over her expression as she did so. She
had been prepared for this news, yet it fell like a fresh
blow upon her heart. That subtle feeling, whose existence
she would not even admit, filled her with indignation
against John Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall leave here and go to his Mrs. John,&rdquo; she
whispered to herself vindictively. &ldquo;I will wait until
Philip leaves the breakfast-room, and then I shall go
to him and tell him all. John Temple had better have
trusted me&mdash;now he shall have to pay the fullest price
for his folly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she only waited until she heard her husband go,
as he was accustomed to do, into the library after breakfast
before she descended the staircase with Henderson&rsquo;s
letter in her hand. She went direct to the library
and entered it, without knocking at the door, and the
squire who was sitting before his writing table looked
up as she did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you not well at breakfast, Rachel?&rdquo; he said,
kindly. &ldquo;Or,&rdquo; he added, noticing the expression of her
face, &ldquo;did anything in that letter that you got vex you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not ill,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but this letter confirmed
some shameful news that I have come to tell
you about John Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shameful news about John Temple!&rdquo; repeated the
squire, pushing back his chair and looking straight at
his wife&rsquo;s pale, determined face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At least I call it shameful,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;to
induce a country girl to leave her home&mdash;a daughter
of one of your own tenants&mdash;to deceive you, his best
friend. Philip, you remember the girl, May Churchill,
who ran away? I suspected at the time that John
Temple had something to do with it, and now I know.
This girl is living at an address in London, and is called
there Mrs. John, and she writes to him here, and if she
is not married to him she ought to be&mdash;and I do not
believe she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never believe this!&rdquo; said the squire, rising in
great emotion, his aged face growing pale. &ldquo;What!
John Temple wrong May Churchill; the little girl I
have known since she was a child; the daughter of a
man like Churchill, whom I respect, and who has lived
on my land since he was a lad, and his father before
him! Rachel, what folly is this? Who has been telling
you this wicked, this insane story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own eyes told me first,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple,
in a hard, concentrated voice, &ldquo;and every word that I
have told you is true. Do you remember when he used
to get large letters which he said were from some late
landlady of his, and contained his unpaid bills? I suspected
at that time he was not speaking the truth, and
a day or two after I learned this was so. He got one
of these large letters at breakfast, and he put it in his
pocket unread. I said at the time, &lsquo;more bills?&rsquo; and he
answered, &lsquo;I am afraid so.&rsquo; Well, after the breakfast
was over, I went upstairs, and passed his sitting-room
door, and it was standing ajar. I wanted to speak to
him about going to call at Homelands, and I went into
the room. He was not there, but an open letter was
lying on the table. I went up to the table and read the
first lines. It began: &lsquo;My dearest, dearest John.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But what of that?&rdquo; said Mr. Temple, angrily.
&ldquo;You had no right to read or look at his letters for
one thing, and for another, how could you tell by whom
this letter was written?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked at the printed address on the paper, and I
remembered it, and just at this moment I saw through
the open bedroom door that John Temple was on the
balcony of the little ante-room beyond. So I turned
and left the sitting-room and he never knew that I had
been there. Then I considered what to do, for I was
determined to bring this home to him, and I suddenly
remembered young Henderson of Stourton Grange&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth had he to do with it?&rdquo; interrupted
the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had been in love, was in love, like the rest of
them, with this girl,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple, scornfully,
&ldquo;and so I used him for my purpose. He had
spoken to me once about his suspicions that Miss
Churchill had eloped with John Temple, or rather that
he had persuaded her to run away from home, so that
he might join her afterward. So I wrote to ask Henderson
to meet me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wrote to ask young Henderson to meet you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, what harm was there in that? I met him near
the West Lodge for a few minutes the day before yesterday,
and I gave him the address I had seen on Miss
Churchill&rsquo;s letter to John Temple, and I asked him to
go up to town and find out the truth about this girl.
He went the same night, and this is the letter I received
from him this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She handed the squire Henderson&rsquo;s letter, with a
trembling hand as she spoke, and her husband&rsquo;s hand
trembled also as he took it. Then he read the words
it contained, and a terribly shocked look came over his
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this be true&mdash;&rdquo; he said, with faltering lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple, positively.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember she ran away, and then after a
week or so he said he was going abroad? He went no
doubt to join her; she was with him all those weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
abroad, and then he must have brought her back to
town, and no doubt would have gone up from time to
time to see her. The whole thing is perfectly plain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then in that case all I can say is that it is a shameful
affair. Most shameful&mdash;but he may have married
her&mdash;probably has, and if he has not done so, he must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Temple went hastily to the bell of the room and
rang it as he spoke, and when the footman answered it,
he said sharply and distinctly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask Mr. John Temple to come here at once; tell
him I wish to see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The footman disappeared with his message, and Mrs.
Temple stood still. She was excited, pale, and determined,
and she did not flinch when she heard John
Temple&rsquo;s step outside the door.</p>

<p>Then he entered and looked at his uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish to see me, Johnson says,&rdquo; he began, but
something in the squire&rsquo;s face told him it was no
ordinary message that he had received.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the squire, &ldquo;I wish to see you, for
I have just heard a tale which, if it be true, will make
me bitterly regret that I ever asked you under my roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is it?&rdquo; asked John Temple, and he drew
himself up to his full height.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is that you induced the young girl May Churchill
to leave her home; that you took her abroad with you,
and that she is now living in London, I presume, under
your protection, and is called Mrs. John. Now answer,
is this true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dark wave of color spread to John Temple&rsquo;s very
brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who has told you this?&rdquo; he said, looking steadily at
his uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife has just told me,&rdquo; answered the squire.
&ldquo;It seems she suspected this, and she saw a letter lying
on your table bearing a certain address in town. She
told young Henderson of this, who it seems is, or was
once, a lover of this poor girl&rsquo;s, and she gave him the
address, and this is the letter she has received this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>The squire handed Henderson&rsquo;s letter to John Temple
as he spoke, and John read it through and then laid it
down quietly on the writing-table before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A truly honorable transaction altogether, I must
say,&rdquo; he said, scornfully, fixing his gray eyes on Mrs.
Temple&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she answered defiantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True or false, it was an action that I thought no
gentlewoman could have been guilty of. What, to send
one man to watch and spy on another man&rsquo;s actions; to
read a letter not intended for your eyes! I could not
have believed you capable of such conduct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s eyes fell before John&rsquo;s reproaches, and
a vague feeling crept into her heart that she had left
her work undone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is useless to talk thus,&rdquo; said the squire, with some
dignity of manner; &ldquo;my wife should not have read
your letter, and I have told her so, but this does not
alter the matter. You have not denied this grave
charge, and if you have done this girl any wrong&mdash;a
girl I have known since her childhood&mdash;you must
undo that wrong as far as lies in your power. I mean
you must marry her, if you have not already done
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple made no answer to this; he stood there
facing his uncle, and Mrs. Temple watched him
fugitively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you married her, or have you not?&rdquo; urged the
squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I decline to answer that question,&rdquo; then said John
Temple. &ldquo;But you said you had regretted that you
had asked me to stay under your roof. You need
regret it no longer, for I will leave to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your leaving will not undo the wrong that you
have done. Think for a moment who this poor girl is,
the daughter of one of my oldest and most respected
tenants; a beautiful girl, of blameless character
hitherto, who perhaps in her foolish love for you
has wrecked her young life. John, you are my
nephew, you are my heir, and I entreat you to act now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
as an honorable man should do, and make her your
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still John Temple made no promise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have read in that letter,&rdquo; continued the squire,
pointing to Henderson&rsquo;s open letter lying on the writing-table,
&ldquo;how this young man is going to her father.
Can you suppose that a respectable man like Churchill
will, for a moment, sit down tamely under such an
insult? No, you will have to answer to him for your
conduct, as well as to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at this moment a rap came to the room door, and
the squire paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he called, and the footman entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; he said, addressing the squire,
&ldquo;Mr. Henderson, of Stourton Grange, and Mr.
Churchill have called, and wish very particularly to
see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; asked the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the hall, sir,&rdquo; replied the footman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can show them in here,&rdquo; said the squire, and
he looked at John Temple as he spoke.</p>

<p>But John Temple made no sign; he had grown a little
pale, and that was all.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />

<small>JOHN TEMPLE LEAVES WOODLEA.</small></h2>


<p>A minute later Henderson and Mr. Churchill entered
the room. Henderson&rsquo;s face was flushed a dusky red,
but Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s looked pale, angry, and determined.
He gave a quick, sharp glance around, and then
advanced toward the squire, who gravely held out his
hand, which, however, his tenant scarcely touched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come on unpleasant business, Mr. Temple,&rdquo; he
said, quickly; and then he looked at John Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean about&mdash;&rdquo; began the squire in faltering
tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean about my daughter, sir! This gentleman,&rdquo;
and he turned to Henderson, &ldquo;has come to me this
morning with a fine tale; he says my girl is living in
London, and that your nephew has placed her there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment or two no one spoke. Mr. Churchill
was looking indignantly at John Temple, and the dark
flush on Henderson&rsquo;s face had deepened, while his eyes
also were fixed with an angry scowl on Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said the squire, in a firmer voice, after a
brief silence; &ldquo;you hear what Mr. Churchill says; is
this charge true or false?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple looked slowly round at each man in
turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I decline to answer any questions on the subject,&rdquo;
he said, in a clear, firm voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve a right to ask questions on the subject,
sir!&rdquo; almost shouted Mr. Churchill, angrily. &ldquo;This
girl, my daughter, disappeared from her home and
nothing has been heard of her since; and now I hear
she is writing to you in a way that if she isn&rsquo;t married
to you she ought to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admit your right to ask questions, Mr. Churchill,&rdquo;
answered John Temple, still firmly; &ldquo;but I have no
right to betray the secrets of others. And if this spy,&rdquo;
and his eyes kindled, and he stretched out his arm in
the direction of Henderson, &ldquo;has already told you so
much, he had better tell you more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dare to call me a spy, sir!&rdquo; cried Henderson,
in a voice hoarse with passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and something worse,&rdquo; answered John Temple,
fiercely; &ldquo;because this young lady rejected your
insolent advances&mdash;advances which were an insult to
her from a man like you; a man who had betrayed and
broken another woman&rsquo;s heart, and then, as I believe
there is a God above us, murdered her&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For an instant Henderson turned ghastly pale, as
this terrible accusation reached his ears, and then, with
a scream of rage, he sprang forward and struck John
Temple a violent blow on the chest. But he had met
his match. For the next moment a swift, hammer-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
thud from John&rsquo;s clenched fist hit his brow, and he
reeled back, and striking his head as he did so against
the sharp corner of the writing table, he fell heavily on
the floor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple gave a cry, and both Mr. Temple and
Mr. Churchill ran forward to his assistance. They
lifted up his head, but he was seemingly unconscious,
and a sudden fear darted into the squire&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;is not dead,&rdquo; he said, falteringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What matter if he is?&rdquo; said John Temple, still
fiercely; and then without another word he turned and
left the room, while the others raised Henderson on a
couch, and Mrs. Temple violently rang the bell for
further help.</p>

<p>In the meantime John Temple had gone to his own
rooms, and for a moment stood there, panting still
from his recent encounter, thinking how he should act.
But his hesitation was very brief. He would go to
May; in her hands alone now lay the course of their
future lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she loves me as I love her, we shall not part,&rdquo; he
thought; &ldquo;the world is wide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was his decision, and he quickly acted on it.
He pulled out a portmanteau, and was thrusting into it
some things that he would require, when a rap sounded
at his sitting-room door, and the next moment Mrs.
Temple, pale and excited, entered the room.</p>

<p>In a second she saw the preparations for his departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are going away?&rdquo; she said, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I would stay?&rdquo; he answered, scornfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple made no answer; she stood there looking
at him, and a strange revulsion of feeling swept
through her breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I do not want to drive you away,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you have done so,&rdquo; answered John Temple,
looking up at her, for he was kneeling on the ground,
packing his portmanteau. &ldquo;But for you this never
would have happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s tall form swayed restlessly, and her
pale, handsome face quivered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I hated to think,&rdquo; she said, with sudden passion,
&ldquo;of your degrading yourself so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not done so,&rdquo; replied John Temple, rising to
his feet and looking at her steadily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have! This girl should have been nothing to
you, nothing! And if in some hour of madness you
had been betrayed into any folly, if you had trusted
me I would have helped you if I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been betrayed into nothing,&rdquo; answered John,
coldly; &ldquo;whatever I have done is by my own will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple began walking restlessly up and down
the room, and then she suddenly stopped before John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came here,&rdquo; she began; &ldquo;you took my boy&rsquo;s
place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know how deeply I grieved for you,&rdquo; said John
Temple; &ldquo;in everything I wished to consider you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you made love to this girl&mdash;this girl, a farmer&rsquo;s
daughter, whose brothers were playing in the fatal
game when my boy was killed! One of them may
have been his murderer; was I believe; and this is how
you showed your consideration for me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Temple, this is unreasonable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is she to you? Answer this question at least;
is she your wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I told them down-stairs, I will betray no one&rsquo;s
secrets without their leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she is, you need never bring her here! You
heard what your uncle said about your marrying her,
but I will not receive her here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall never be asked to do so, nor will I ever
return. What my uncle said was worthy of him&mdash;the
words of a good man, whom I most heartily like and
respect&mdash;but I will trouble you with my presence here
no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Temple began those restless pacings up
and down the floor; in her anger she had done what she
did not wish to do&mdash;driven John Temple away&mdash;and
now she was sorely repenting her own action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there is one thing I wish to say before I go,&rdquo;
continued John Temple, &ldquo;that I thank you for all your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
kindness to me while I have been here. I came to your
house under most painful circumstances, but you over-looked
this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not go!&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Temple, impetuously;
&ldquo;at least, not yet; let us think what can be done, what
it will be best to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what it is best for me to do,&rdquo; answered John
Temple, who was now in the act of locking the small
portmanteau he meant to carry away with him, &ldquo;and
that is to leave Woodlea at once&mdash;good-by, Mrs.
Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not offer her his hand, but she took it almost
against his will, and held it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been so lonely,&rdquo; she said, in a broken voice;
&ldquo;so miserably lonely&mdash;and now I will be more lonely
still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple made no answer to this appeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bid good-by to my uncle for me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as I do
not care, in my present temper, to encounter again
those two men down-stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if you have killed Henderson? They were
sending for the doctor for him as I came upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I have I can not say I shall deeply regret it, and
I am ready to answer for this, as for the rest. But not
he! A brute like that is not killed by a blow on the
head; and now once more good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was gone before she could speak again, and Mrs.
Temple sat down and looked around the desolate rooms.
She had admired him during the last half-hour; admired
his bravery and independence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all he had a right to choose a woman he liked
best,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;but it is a terrible mistake. A man
who marries a woman of inferior birth and position
always repents it&mdash;and with such relations!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After awhile, however, she pulled herself together,
and went down-stairs, and when she entered the library
she found the village doctor there, as well as her husband
and Mr. Churchill.</p>

<p>Henderson was lying on the couch ghastly pale, with
a handkerchief bound around his head, and still insensible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
and the doctor was bending over him holding his
wrist.</p>

<p>Then when the squire saw his wife, he stepped back
toward her and half-whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is John Temple?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is gone,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and he says he will
never return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Temple upon this beckoned to Mr. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Temple says my nephew has left the house,
Mr. Churchill,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll follow him,&rdquo; answered the farmer, sturdily;
&ldquo;you have told me, squire, that if he has not already
done my girl justice that you wish him and authorize
him to do so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; replied Mr. Temple; &ldquo;I am ready
and wishful to receive your daughter as his wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir, with all my heart. Will you give
me the address, madam, where she is, for all this has
well-nigh put it out of my head,&rdquo; he added, addressing
Mrs. Temple, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll go up to London to-night, or
to-morrow at latest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple went to the writing-table without a
word, and wrote down Miss Webster&rsquo;s address in Pembridge
Terrace, which she remembered only too well,
and handed it to Mr. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you kindly, madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and now, as
the doctor&rsquo;s here, and the squire, I think I&rsquo;ll go, as I
leave Mr. Henderson in such good hands, and I have
my missus to consult a bit, and some business to see
about before I can get off to London. Good-morning,
madam; good-morning, squire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Mr. Churchill went away, but he was scarcely
gone when Mrs. Layton rushed hastily into the room.
She had heard a report somehow that there had been
a quarrel between young Henderson and John Temple,
and that the doctor had been sent for, so she had
hurried up to the Hall to see and hear all about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this, Rachel!&rdquo; she cried, looking at the
prostrate figure on the couch. &ldquo;Whatever has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Temple shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means a fight,&rdquo; she said, scornfully, &ldquo;and there
is the fallen one!&rdquo; And she pointed to Henderson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what on earth did they quarrel about?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Layton, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The village beauty,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple, still
more scornfully; &ldquo;it seems my nephew, John Temple,
had run away with Miss Churchill, and his uncle has
given his consent to his marriage with her, so we may
expect her here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; almost screamed Mrs. Layton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rachel,&rdquo; said the squire in grave reproof, &ldquo;is this
a way in which to speak of a most painful affair? If
John Temple did induce this young lady to leave her
home, as you say he did, he is bound in honor to make
her his wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To make Margaret Churchill his wife!&rdquo; screamed
Mrs. Layton. &ldquo;Why, squire, you must be mad to dream
of such a thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The squire gave a contemptuous bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may have your ideas, madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
I have mine. I have told you what mine are, and in
my own house. I&rsquo;ll see they are respected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Layton&rsquo;s face fell; the squire might be mad,
was mad to talk thus, but still he was the master of the
house from which so many good things went to the
vicarage, and she could not afford to quarrel with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I did not mean that,&rdquo; she began, but
with another bow Mr. Temple left the room, and Mrs.
Layton was alone with her daughter, except for the
presence of the doctor and the unconscious Henderson,
who were quite at the other end of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you long ago,&rdquo; hissed Mrs. Layton in
her daughter&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;what this John Temple was? A
viper, a scorpion, and now he&rsquo;s turned and stung you!
Oh! that I should ever live to see that upstart here!
Margaret Churchill indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not here yet,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple, bitterly;
&ldquo;ten to one John Temple will never marry her&mdash;why
should he?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />

<small>TOO BITTER TO BE BORNE.</small></h2>


<p>It was still very early in the day when John Temple
left Woodlea, in a state of strong though suppressed
excitement. It had come so suddenly, this discovery,
this exposure, that he had dreaded far more on May&rsquo;s
account than his own. But he must face the situation;
he told himself this as he strode across the dewy park,
as he went on with rapid steps toward the nearest railway
station.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch; there was a train passed for
the south at a quarter past eleven o&rsquo;clock, and he made
up his mind to endeavor to reach the station in time to
travel by this. He had not a moment to spare. On he
went with a pale, set face and compressed lips, running
a race, as it were, with the train. And as he entered
the station the engine puffed up on the metals outside.
But John Temple was known to the station-master, and
when he called out for a ticket to London, the station-master
told him to hurry on the platform, and that he
would follow with the ticket.</p>

<p>All this happened so quickly that John Temple had
little time to think. It was not until he found himself
actually in the train, speeding on his way to town, that
he began quite to realize what was before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor May, my poor, sweet May!&rdquo; he almost groaned.
For well he knew that the news he was bearing her
would well-nigh break her heart. And he could not
now keep it from her. Her father was certain now to
find her, and the only thing in John&rsquo;s favor was that he
had the start of him. There was not another train
south for some hours, and in the meanwhile John determined
to see May, to try to induce her to seek a new
home in another land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can go to Australia,&rdquo; he told himself; &ldquo;who is
to know anything there? and I have enough to live on,
and as for Woodlea, what is that to my poor, poor girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>But it was a terrible task that he had before him, and
he shrank from it with utter loathing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why was I so weak?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I should
have told her the truth. I was led away by her beauty,
by her love, and went drifting on, and now she must
know everything. But if she loves me best of all it
may still come right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to buoy himself up with this idea. He
thought of May&rsquo;s tenderness; her devotion, and remembered
how she had told him hers was &ldquo;the love that
can not change.&rdquo; The test had come; the bitter test
she had never dreamed of, and he had to face the most
painful ordeal of his life.</p>

<p>All too soon it seemed to him he saw the smoke of
the great city; all too soon he was speeding through
tunnels, and being carried rapidly over housetops.
Then came the rush and hurry of a great terminus.
John Temple had reached his destination, and as he
entered a cab and told the driver to convey him to Miss
Webster&rsquo;s house in Pembridge Terrace, it was with a
sinking heart and faltering tongue.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile at Pembridge Terrace everything
seemed as quiet and peaceable as usual. Yet there was
secret anxiety in the hearts of the two kind women of
the house. For there had been something in their
nephew&rsquo;s manner during his visits of late that had certainly
alarmed them. Ralph Webster had in truth
been so restless, so unlike himself, that they could not
understand him. He was indeed in a state of mind
most unusual to his strong and determined nature, for
he knew not how to act. His duty and sense of right
urged him one way he told himself, and then, when he
looked on May&rsquo;s sweet, happy face he felt it almost
impossible for him to be the one who could strike her
so dire a blow.</p>

<p>But of one thing he had no doubt, which was the
certainty of John Temple&rsquo;s early marriage to Kathleen
Weir. He had even gone to the city church she had
named and examined the register of the ill-suited marriage
which had ended so disastrously. He had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Kathleen Weir since his interview with Mr. Harrison,
the solicitor, but he had not told her that Mr. Harrison
knew of the identity of the John Temple who had
married her, and paid her a yearly allowance, and the
John Temple who had become the heir of the Woodlea
property through the death of his young cousin.</p>

<p>He had left this point in doubt purposely, thinking it
might hasten the catastrophe if it were known for the
unhappy girl who in his eyes had been so shamefully
deceived. But the actress seemed determined to learn
the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely the old fox is keeping it back,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;he would be sure I should want more money if I
knew, and Dereham was so positive about the matter.
What do you think it would be best for me to do? To
write to Mr. Harrison himself, or send a letter to John
Temple through him; for, of course, he knows his
address?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should do nothing immediately, I think,&rdquo; answered
Ralph Webster, and the handsome actress looked at
him and wondered what was his motive as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see him, mind,&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;to
see him now would be as disagreeable to me as no
doubt to him; it&rsquo;s a mere matter of money, nothing
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Well, I&rsquo;ll try to find out all about it
for a certainty in the course of a few days; and now I
must go, for I promised to dine with my aunts in Pembridge
Terrace this evening,&rdquo; and Webster rose and
held out his hand as he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a wonderfully attentive nephew you are!&rdquo;
said Kathleen Weir, also rising, with a light laugh.
&ldquo;Do you know I&rsquo;m beginning to believe there is something
behind these two respectable old ladies? A
pretty cousin, eh? Or, perhaps, even a housemaid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster&rsquo;s dark face colored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no cousin,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;and as far as I
remember the housemaid is a remarkably plain-featured
young woman, so you see you are wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like my interest in John Temple then, a mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
matter of money,&rdquo; smiled the actress, showing her
white teeth. &ldquo;Ah, well, my friend, such is life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such, indeed,&rdquo; thought Webster, bitterly, as he
descended the stone flight of steps that led to Miss
Kathleen Weir&rsquo;s flat; &ldquo;here is a tragedy and a comedy
combined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did really dine with his aunts, and it was during
the evening that both Miss Margaret and Miss Eliza
became convinced that, as they expressed it, he had
&ldquo;something on his mind.&rdquo; His dark, resolute eyes
lingered on the sweet face opposite him, and his usually
fluent tongue was seldom heard. He went away
early, and he went away as irresolute how he should
act as when he arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ralph doesn&rsquo;t look well,&rdquo; said Miss Margaret, as the
door closed behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; sighed Miss Eliza.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how silent he was!&rdquo; smiled May.</p>

<p>But the day after this visit, the very next day, she
knew what had made him silent and sad. It was a
dreary day, dull, and at times wet, and during the
afternoon, about four o&rsquo;clock, Miss Margaret, Miss
Eliza, and May were all sitting in the dining-room at
Pembridge Terrace, where a cheery fire helped to
exclude some of the gloom outside. Miss Margaret
was knitting, Miss Eliza reading a novel, and May
seemingly reading a novel, but really thinking of John
Temple. The sound of a cab stopping at the door,
however, interrupted all their occupations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can that be Ralph?&rdquo; said Miss Margaret, looking
up.</p>

<p>May also looked up and turned her head so that she
could see out of the window, and the next moment rose
with a glad cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s John!&rdquo; she said, and as she spoke she ran out
of the room into the hall, just as John Temple was
entering it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John! dear John!&rdquo; she cried, and without a word
he took her in his arms and pressed her, nay crushed
her, against his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo; again May murmured, and then she raised
her head and looked in his face.</p>

<p>It was pale and agitated, and he spoke no word. And
as she looked at him he pressed his lips on hers and
something in his expression, something even in his
touch, with the swift and subtle knowledge of love,
thrilled her heart with sudden fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is anything the matter?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;John,
are you ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not very well,&rdquo; he answered, slowly and painfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry&mdash;how long have you been ill?&rdquo;
asked May, anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only tired, I think; I will tell the driver of the
cab to stop&mdash;I want you to go out with me for a little
while, May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, but first come in and rest,&rdquo; answered
May, uneasily, for his manner was so strange.</p>

<p>John Temple went down the steps to speak to the
driver, and May stood at the open door watching him.
Then he reascended the steps, and she shut the door
behind him and put her arm through his, and together
they entered the dining-room where Miss Webster and
Miss Eliza were standing, full of expectation and
excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John is not very well, Miss Webster,&rdquo; said May, a
little tremulously; &ldquo;I think he wants nursing and being
taken care of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; said the two kind ladies, almost
with one breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nothing,&rdquo; answered John, nervously, as he
shook hands with them; &ldquo;I am tired, that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have some wine or some tea. You must
stay to dinner, of course?&rdquo; the next moment suggested
hospitable Miss Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I will take a glass of wine,&rdquo; answered John,
&ldquo;but I will not stay to dinner; I am going to take May
out to dine with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both the sisters protested against this, but John
Temple was firm, and after he had taken his wine he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
looked at May, and asked her to get ready to go out
with him. May rose at once to obey his wish, but she
still felt uneasy. John was not like himself; his smile
was strained, his very voice was different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something is worrying him dreadfully, I am sure,&rdquo;
she told herself as she hurried on her hat and cape, and
when she turned to the sitting-room and told John she
was ready, to her surprise John put out his hand to take
leave of Miss Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll bring May back; we will see you, then?&rdquo;
said Miss Webster, also surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, I forgot,&rdquo; answered John, and then he led
May to the cab, and, having placed her in it, took his
seat by her side.</p>

<p>May slid her little hand into his as the horse
started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, I am sure something is vexing you,&rdquo; she said,
tenderly and anxiously, looking at his half-averted face;
&ldquo;have you any bad news to tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some news,&rdquo; he answered, with an effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it bad news?&rdquo; urged May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not tell you here; wait until we get to the
hotel&mdash;I will tell you then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But John&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, dear; you will hear it soon enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke huskily, almost hoarsely, and he turned
away his head from her tender gaze. After this they
drove on almost in silence until they reached the Grosvenor
Hotel, where John usually stayed when he was in
town. When he arrived there he ordered rooms and
dinner, and then when they were alone May once more
looked at him questioningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me now, John, what is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May&mdash;&rdquo; began John, and then he paused, absolutely
unable to find words to tell her the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do tell me, John!&rdquo; she prayed, and she laid her
hand beseechingly on his arm.</p>

<p>Then he looked at her, and there was great pain in
his eyes and on his pale face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should rather be dead&mdash;I swear it, though you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
may not believe it&mdash;than say to you what I am forced
to say to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you frighten me! What can it be?&rdquo; cried
May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember when&mdash;when I went away and
left you, May,&rdquo; went on John Temple, in a broken
voice; &ldquo;when I wrote to you and told you that you
were to be quite sure of your feelings toward me if
I were to be anything more to you; when I told you
that I believed that if two people truly loved each
other that nothing should part or change them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; answered May, lifting her head and
looking with steadfast eyes in his face, &ldquo;when you
wrote that there were other feelings between men
and women besides the love that can not change, and
that I was to question my heart. I did&mdash;I told you
then my love could never change, and now I tell you
again&mdash;it can never change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He caught her to his breast, he kissed her eyes, her
lips, her brow, and then in hurried, agitated words he
tried to tell her all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May, I loved you then, and I love you now, how
dearly none but my own heart can tell&mdash;but I should
have told you the truth. I told you there were obstacles
to our marriage, and that it must be a secret one,
and you agreed to this. Our secret is now known.
Mrs. Temple, my uncle&rsquo;s wife, it seems, saw one of your
letters to me, and she actually sent that brute, young
Henderson, up to town to spy on you. He saw you
enter Miss Webster&rsquo;s house, and he went back and told
your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! John!&rdquo; cried May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle sent for me this morning, and questioned
me, but I would tell him nothing; and while I was with
him your father and young Henderson arrived at the
Hall. Your father asked me if I were married to you,
and I refused to tell him also, and then when Henderson
spoke I called him a murderer and a spy. He
sprang at me and struck me, but with one blow I sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
him reeling to the floor, and when I left Woodlea he
had not recovered his senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May gave a sort of cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and what followed?&rdquo; she gasped out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I left Woodlea. I was determined to see you
first before I said a word to one of them&mdash;for, May, it
was not for fear of my uncle&rsquo;s anger that I wished our
marriage to be a secret one&mdash;but there was another
reason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another reason?&rdquo; echoed May, with fast whitening
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, when I was a boy, a mere lad at least, I met a
woman older than myself; a woman who took advantage
of my boyish infatuation, and led me on to do what I
have cursed ever since I met you. May, do not look so
white! My dear one, this need not, shall not, part us.
Our love is too deep and strong for a tie, broken years
ago, to come between us. But in an hour of madness,
I married&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>May started back as if she had received a sudden
blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I married,&rdquo; went on John Temple, nerving himself
to speak the words, &ldquo;the actress, Kathleen Weir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he said no more; May&rsquo;s lips parted, she gasped as
if for breath, and then as John Temple caught her in
his arms she sank senseless on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God! has it killed her!&rdquo; he cried in sudden
anguish, looking at her white and clammy face. He
lifted her up, he placed her on a couch, he rang the bell
wildly for assistance. But May lay like one dead. One
arm fell motionless at her side; John grasped her wrist
and could feel no pulsation. Again he rang madly at
the bell, and this time it was answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lady has fainted!&rdquo; he cried to the astonished
waiter. &ldquo;Bring water, brandy&mdash;send some of the
women here, and get a doctor at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few minutes several people were in the room,
and some of the female servants began bathing May&rsquo;s
brow and hands with water, while John Temple tried
to wet her lips with the spirits they had brought him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
He knelt down at her side; he called her by every
endearing name, but still May made no sign. Then a
doctor hurried in and proceeded to use remedies to
revive the senseless girl. And at last, with faint, gasping
sighs, a tinge of color stole back to the white face,
and presently May opened her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dearest, my darling, are you better now?&rdquo; whispered
John Temple, bending over her, and holding one
of her cold hands fast in his.</p>

<p>May tried to speak, but no words came from her pale
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not crowd round her,&rdquo; said the doctor, looking
up; &ldquo;let her have plenty of air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those standing near fell back, but John Temple did
not stir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the attack come on suddenly, sir?&rdquo; asked the
doctor, addressing John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, she will be better presently. Try to
swallow this, madam; it will do you good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May tried to swallow the restorative the doctor held
toward her, and its effect was soon visible. It brought
back memory&mdash;infinite pain! She looked at John Temple,
and he saw she was remembering his words. He
bent closer to her; he whispered that nothing should
ever part them; he asked her for his sake to get well;
and the doctor, watching her face, slightly touched
John Temple on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you some directions,&rdquo; he said, and as John
rose, he drew him to one side of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must not be excited,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;as far as I can
judge, this attack has been brought on by some mental
shock. Is there any tendency to heart affection?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know of none,&rdquo; answered John, with quivering
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she your wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, keep her very quiet for the next few hours,
and do not talk to her of anything that would be likely
to disquiet her. Are you staying here?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; again answered John, briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will look in this evening then. For the present,
everyone but yourself is best out of the room. But be
sure you keep her quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he gave some further directions, and finally left
the room, and presently John and May were once more
alone. She lay quite still, but that terrible look of pain
never left her face. John went and sat by her, and
took her hand, but he dare not talk to her after what
the doctor had said. And so the time passed on, and
after an hour or so, May herself broke the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she said in a feeble voice, &ldquo;I have something
to say to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, my darling? But you had best not talk
of anything just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to say&mdash;I can not go back to Pembridge
Terrace,&rdquo; went on May, still in those faltering accents;
&ldquo;I can not see my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not, May&mdash;I swear you shall not! This
was why I brought you away. You shall see no one,
and we will go to Australia together; go anywhere you
like, and you shall be my own dear wife always; my
own sweet, dear wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A faint shudder ran through May&rsquo;s frame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing shall ever part us, May,&rdquo; continued John
Temple, and once more he knelt down by her side
and took both her hands in his. &ldquo;We could not live
apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May looked in his face with strange wistfulness, and
a quiver passed over her pale lips, and then she drew
John&rsquo;s hand closer to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could not live apart,&rdquo; she murmured, and then
she sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will not, but I want to spare you all possible
annoyance and worry, May. When you feel a little
better, I think it would be best for me to drive over to
Miss Webster&rsquo;s, and tell her that as you are not feeling
very well, you are not going to return there this evening,
and that to-morrow you are going away for a few
days with me, I will ask them to give me what you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
will require, and I will not tell them where you are; or
rather I shall not give them the right address. Thus,
if your father goes there to-morrow, he will not find
you, and to-morrow I think we had better cross to
France, and we can settle our future plans there, out
of the way of everyone. What do you think of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>May lay silent for a moment or two; then she said,
slowly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, John, that will be best; you had best go now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are you well enough for me to leave you? I do
not like leaving you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again May sighed wearily, and then raised herself up
and put her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better go,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and&mdash;and John, will
you remember that&mdash;that I will always love you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it; you give me fresh life, May&mdash;well,
then, good-by, though I shall soon be back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their lips met in one long, tender, clinging kiss, and
then John Temple reluctantly left her. But on the
whole his mind was somewhat relieved. She had borne
it better than he expected; at all events she had said
they could not live apart.</p>

<p>But scarcely had the door of the room closed behind
him when a great change came over May&rsquo;s face.
There came over it despair&mdash;blank, bitter despair.
She sat up and thought. She put her hand to her
brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not bear it,&rdquo; she said, half-aloud; &ldquo;it is too
hard to bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She remembered all her sweet love-dream in these
brief moments; remembered John Temple standing
with her in the moonlit garden of Woodside; remembered
his looks, the touch of his dear hand! And it
had been all folly! He, the husband of another woman,
must have known she could never be his wife. He had
been amusing himself; she had been his plaything;
what else could she be now?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can but die,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;I could not live without
him&mdash;I will die, and then he will know I loved him
to the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>She rose and tottered to her feet. She felt a great
bodily weakness as though every nerve were unstrung.
The restorative the doctor had left was standing on the
table, and she drank some of this, and it seemed to give
her strength. Her hat was lying near her, and she put
it on and tried to walk feebly across the room. She
had no plans, but somehow she thought of the river
gliding through the great city, and hiding dark sin and
sorrow beneath its murky flood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would hide me,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;hide my shame
forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She opened the room door and went out on the corridor,
and then walked feebly down the broad staircase.
No one stopped her or interfered with her, and in a few
moments she reached the hall. One of the servants
here came forward and asked her if she required a cab.
But she shook her head, and went down the steps into
the lighted streets, alone with her broken heart.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />

<small>DESPAIR.</small></h2>


<p>The noise and glare outside almost overwhelmed
May as she went tottering feebly on. She knew not
which way to turn, and felt that her weary feet would
not bear her much farther. She stopped and looked
half-dazed around. And as she did so a lamplight fell
on her white and haggard face, showing it plainly to a
man who was just about to pass her when she paused.
This was Ralph Webster, but he did not recognize her.
This pale-faced, miserable looking woman, whose features
somehow reminded him of the beautiful, blooming
girl he had seen last night at his aunt&rsquo;s house, however,
interested him. He, too, stopped after he had
passed her, and looked back. She was beckoning for a
cab, and a moment later one drew up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>The driver bent forward and asked her where she
wished to go. The woman Webster was watching
hesitated, got slowly into the cab, and then he heard
her voice. He started; it was the voice of May, and
the words she uttered sounded strange and ominous to
his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take me to one of the bridges,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which one, miss?&rdquo; inquired the driver.</p>

<p>Once more there was a pause before the answer
came. Then again he heard May&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Westminster,&rdquo; she said, and in an instant&mdash;swift
as a flash of lightning&mdash;it darted across Ralph Webster&rsquo;s
acute brain that this actually might be May
Churchill; that she might have learned the secret of
which he was but too sure!</p>

<p>He made a hasty step toward the cab, but as he did
so it started. But Webster was not a man to hesitate
with such a doubt on his mind. At once he, too, hailed
a cab, and bade the driver follow the one before him at
his utmost speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Westminster Bridge,&rdquo; he called as he leaped in,
&ldquo;and do not lose sight of the cab before us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The driver nodded and the race began. It was easy
enough at first, but in the more crowded parts it was
very difficult. One hansom cab is so like the other
that to keep one particular cab in view was no easy
task. The driver, however, did his best, but, unhappily,
a slight block stopped them for a minute or two. Webster
sat burning with impatience, but there was nothing
for it but to wait. At last they were off again, and at
last, too, they came in sight of the bridge. Then when
they reached it Webster sprang out of the cab, and flung
half a sovereign to the driver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait for me here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I may want you
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he went on along the footpath, and, halfway
across the bridge, he saw another cab drawn up at one
side of the roadway, and as he approached this cab
the driver beckoned to a passing policeman, and for a
moment Webster paused to listen to what he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; called the cabman, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a lady just got
out of this &lsquo;ere cab that I think ye&rsquo;d best look after.
She looked uncommon queer, and she told me to drive
to one of the bridges; I wish she may not be after some
mischief or other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way did she go?&rdquo; asked the policeman, interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Straight ahead, and she&rsquo;d a wild, dazed look I didn&rsquo;t
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster listened no longer. With swift steps he
walked on, peering around him as he went. The
bridge was fairly crowded, but he pushed his way, and
in a little while he saw the figure of a woman before
him; of a woman whose form reminded him of the
slender girlish one of whom he was thinking. Some
passer-by went roughly against her, and she reeled to
one side, and leaned panting against the parapet of the
bridge.</p>

<p>In an instant Webster was at her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did that man hurt you?&rdquo; he asked, quickly.</p>

<p>Then the woman turned her head, and Webster saw
the white, despairing face, and the large, violet-rimmed
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you Miss Churchill?&rdquo; said Webster, in a low
tone, and he laid his hand gently on her arm.</p>

<p>A cry broke from May&rsquo;s white lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t speak to me, Mr. Webster. Oh! leave me
alone&mdash;please leave me alone!&rdquo; she gasped out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not leave you alone,&rdquo; answered Ralph Webster
firmly; &ldquo;I can not leave you here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment the policeman the cabman had
spoken to came up to them, and stopped and looked at
May suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the young woman the cabman was speaking
of, sir?&rdquo; he said, addressing Webster. &ldquo;I saw
you pass when he was telling me to look after her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Webster, quietly; &ldquo;this young lady is a
friend of mine; and a man pushed against her, and she
has turned rather faint. You had best take my arm,&rdquo;
he added, addressing May, and without any permission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
he drew her arm through his, and led her
quietly on.</p>

<p>For a few moments May did not speak, nor did he.
Then, with his voice full of feeling, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard some bad news&mdash;I fear I know
what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May&rsquo;s whole form quivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! go away and leave me alone, Mr. Webster,&rdquo;
she once more prayed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell anyone you&rsquo;ve seen
me&mdash;I only wish to be alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not fit to be alone,&rdquo; answered Webster;
&ldquo;you have received a great mental shock, a shock that
I have feared for days must come to you&mdash;you have
learnt the truth, somehow, about Mr. Temple and Miss
Kathleen Weir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May gave a sudden cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; she asked, in a broken voice.
&ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Weir told me&mdash;of her early marriage to Mr.
Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you knew this and never told me!&rdquo; cried May.
&ldquo;You let me live on in my&mdash;fool&rsquo;s happiness&mdash;you let
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here her voice broke; she covered her face with
her hand; a moan broke from, her parched lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not bear to disturb your happiness,&rdquo; said
Webster, gently. &ldquo;I was distressed above measure
when this strange knowledge came to me. I did not
know how to act, and last night when I was at Pembridge
Terrace&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never go there again!&rdquo; broke in May, passionately.
&ldquo;I will never see anyone again that I have
known. You must forget this meeting, Mr. Webster;
you must never tell anyone that you have seen me.
Will you promise me this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only on one condition&mdash;that you will try to bear this
bitter blow with fortitude&mdash;otherwise it is my duty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I bear it?&rdquo; moaned the unhappy girl.
&ldquo;He&mdash;was everything to me&mdash;I believed he loved
me&mdash;and now, and now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no blame to be attached to you. It is a
most painful and trying position, and I do not wonder
at you shrinking back from it, yet I am sure that both
my aunts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Webster,&rdquo; interrupted May, &ldquo;do not speak of
this. I will never see your aunts again&mdash;never! My
father is going there to-morrow&mdash;do you think I
could face him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon my asking you, but how do you know all
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he came to-day,&rdquo; answered May in broken
accents; &ldquo;he took me out&mdash;and told me. He&mdash;said
our secret marriage was known&mdash;for we were married&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you were; Mr. Temple has rendered himself
liable by his conduct&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo; asked May, quickly, as Webster paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To an action for bigamy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said May, sharply and quickly, and for the
first time she raised her bowed head. &ldquo;I will do nothing
against him; I will say nothing against him&mdash;I
will disappear&mdash;and you must keep my secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do anything for you. Will you trust me?&rdquo;
answered Webster, earnestly. &ldquo;I know at the present
time you are overwhelmed with the suddenness of the
blow, and no one can wonder at it. But how did you
come to be out here alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;Mr. Temple,&rdquo; faltered May, &ldquo;left me for a
little time, he supposed, and went to your aunts. He&mdash;he
did not wish me to leave him; he did not know I
never meant to see him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then you went out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went out never to return. I will never return! I
will never return, Mr. Webster&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;have not
strength&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor, poor girl,&rdquo; said Webster, very pityingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now will you leave me, Mr. Webster?&rdquo; went on
May, who was trembling in every limb; &ldquo;I&mdash;I am
better now&mdash;good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not leave you,&rdquo; answered Webster, quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
and firmly. &ldquo;I will stay with you until I see you in
some safe shelter. I do not wonder at your decision
not to return to Mr. Temple, and it is natural that just
at first you should shrink from seeing those that you
have known. But Fate has thrown me in your path,
and it is my duty to watch over you. Turn with me
now; I have a cab waiting at the other end of the
bridge, and we can settle as we drive where you shall
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I can not go, I can not go!&rdquo; moaned May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must,&rdquo; said Webster; &ldquo;do you think I would
leave you alone in the miserable, desperate state you
are in? I do not ask you to go back to Pembridge
Terrace, or to see your father or Mr. Temple; all I
ask you to do is to come with me, and I will take the
best care of you that I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and you will tell no one where I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I solemnly promise I will tell no one where you
are, if in return you will promise to do nothing rash.
Miss Churchill, no man is worth it,&rdquo; he added, half
bitterly. &ldquo;But come, now, let us go back to the cab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But by this time May&rsquo;s trembling limbs had well-nigh
failed her. She tottered on for a few minutes
more, clinging to Webster&rsquo;s arm for support, and then
a deadly faintness suddenly overcame her, and she
would have fallen to the ground had not Webster held
her in his arms.</p>

<p>But when he saw her condition, he at once made up
his mind. He called a passing cab; he lifted May in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drive as direct as you can to St. Phillip&rsquo;s Hospital,&rdquo;
he told the cabman.</p>

<p>At the great hospital which I here call St. Phillip&rsquo;s
Webster had suddenly remembered that he was a personal
friend of the house surgeon, Doctor Brentwood.
He remembered also that private patients could find
accommodation there, and that there were private
rooms where May could be nursed and taken care of.</p>

<p>Until she had fainted he had not known where to take
her. Now her illness settled the matter, and half an
hour later May was borne into the great gloomy building,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
where the sick and suffering spent their weary
hours. But first Webster had a short, whispered conversation
with his friend the house surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, money is no consideration, Brentwood,&rdquo;
this conversation ended with; &ldquo;but she must not be left
alone; a nurse must never leave her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Brentwood nodded his head and went to look
after his new patient. Webster had told him as much
of May&rsquo;s story as he deemed necessary, and the doctor
quite understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a woman in terrible grief,&rdquo; Webster had said,
&ldquo;and she might do something desperate unless she is
well looked after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus when May regained complete consciousness she
found herself in a small, neat, clean room, with a bright
fire burning in the grate, and a neat hospital nurse
standing by her bedside. Doctor Brentwood was also
in the room, and when May looked round and asked
the nurse where she was, he too went up to the bedside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you are better now, I see,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; asked May again. &ldquo;I think I must
have fainted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are in the private patients&rsquo; ward in St. Phillip&rsquo;s
Hospital. Yes, you fainted, but I hope you will soon be
all right after you have had a night&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May put her hand over her face; she was recalling
her interview with Ralph Webster on the bridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who brought me here?&rdquo; she asked, presently, in a
low, pained tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Webster&mdash;Ralph Webster; you are a friend of
his, he tells me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment or two May said nothing, and the doctor
was turning away to give some directions to the
nurse, when she once more addressed him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I see Mr. Webster?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you wish it. I will bring him to you at
once,&rdquo; replied Doctor Brentwood; and a few minutes
later Webster was in the room.</p>

<p>He went up not unmoved to the bed on which May
was lying, with her white face and her loosed hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Brentwood says you are better, and that you
wish to see me?&rdquo; he said, in a low tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I wish to see you alone for a few minutes,&rdquo;
answered May.</p>

<p>Webster looked at the doctor, and the doctor looked
at the nurse, and then they both left the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Webster,&rdquo; began May, brokenly and agitatedly,
&ldquo;you have brought me here against my will&mdash;but will
you promise me at least one thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will promise you anything you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell no one where I am; remember, no one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I faithfully promise you I will not. You are in a
safe refuge here, and no one shall come near you nor
molest you unless you wish it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish them to think me dead,&rdquo; said May, in a low,
emphatic voice; &ldquo;I wish everyone to think me dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not betray your secret,&rdquo; answered Webster,
and he stretched out his hand and took hers. &ldquo;Will
you trust me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and&mdash;and do not tell them my name here.
You have not told them my name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not; Doctor Brentwood is an old friend of
mine, and I know you will be well looked after under
his care. Try to sleep, and forget what has happened;
and what name shall I call you by?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, anything; it is no matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster thought for a moment or two, and then he
once more took May&rsquo;s hand in his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will call you Mrs. Church,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that will do,
and now good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br />

<small>REMORSE.</small></h2>


<p>After John Temple had left May he drove straight
to Pembridge Terrace, feeling that the worst of a most
painful day was over. At all events May would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
leave him, and in another country they would both forget
the past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who knows what may happen?&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;That woman,&rdquo; and his brow darkened, &ldquo;is not likely
to lead, or to go on leading, an immaculate life. I may
be able to get a divorce, and the moment I can I will
marry May. My dear little May, if I have wronged
you, it was because I loved you so well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So thinking of her tenderly, fondly, he arrived at
Pembridge Terrace, and when he entered the dining-room
where the two sisters were alone, they both
almost at once exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mrs. John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not very well, I&rsquo;m sorry to say,&rdquo; answered
John Temple, &ldquo;and I persuaded her to stay at the
hotel, and let me come on alone to you. I am going
to take her to-morrow for a day or two to the sea, as we
both want a little change, I think, and I have come to
tell you this, and ask if you will kindly let your maid
pack a few things that May will require, and I will take
them back in the cab with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is sudden!&rdquo; cried Miss Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she is not ill, is she?&rdquo; inquired kindly Miss
Eliza.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but she was tired, so I thought she was better
where she was than driving through the streets. She
will write to you to-morrow, most likely, and I scarcely
know how to thank you for all your kindness to her&mdash;poor
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a tender ring in John&rsquo;s voice as he said
the last two words that both the gentle-hearted women
noticed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been a great pleasure to us to have her here,&rdquo;
said Miss Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a sweet flower,&rdquo; sighed Miss Eliza.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear girl,&rdquo; said John Temple; and for a
moment&mdash;just a moment&mdash;a sort of moisture stole over
his gray eyes.</p>

<p>After this Miss Webster hurried out of the room, to
pack, or superintend the packing of, what she thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
May would require during her few days&rsquo; proposed
excursion to the sea. Thus Miss Eliza was left to entertain
John Temple, which she found by no means easy
to do. He was absent-minded and silent, and rose
quickly when Miss Webster and the maid returned
with May&rsquo;s packed portmanteau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have put everything in I thought she would
want,&rdquo; said Miss Webster; &ldquo;but if I have forgotten
anything, if she will telegraph I will send it at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure it is all right,&rdquo; said John, and he held out
his hand to Miss Webster, thinking that most likely it
would be the last time for years that he would press
that kindly palm. &ldquo;Good-by, Miss Webster; good-by,
Miss Eliza; and thank you for all your great kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left the house a few minutes later, and it was
strange that both the sisters were somewhat impressed
by his manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looked very serious,&rdquo; said Miss Webster. &ldquo;I am sure I hope nothing is wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it has come out about their marriage, and
he has quarreled with his uncle?&rdquo; suggested Miss
Eliza.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile John Temple was driving back
to his hotel, his thoughts still dwelling very tenderly
on May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will make it all up to her,&rdquo; he was thinking; &ldquo;my
little Mayflower shall never regret her choice, nor her
love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had grown almost cheerful by the time he had
reached the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, it was dull enough at Woodlea,&rdquo; he was
reflecting; &ldquo;and I can&rsquo;t quite understand Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s
attitude. We shall be happier out of it all; out of civilization
for awhile&mdash;I think I shall like a different
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He soon arrived at the hotel, paid his cab fare, and
then ran lightly up the staircase, after giving May&rsquo;s
portmanteau to one of the waiters to carry. He knew
the number of the sitting-room where he had left May,
as he was well-acquainted with the hotel, and when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
reached the door he opened it without rapping. One
glance round the room told him it was empty. But
this did not make him uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has been too tired to sit up,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and
has gone to bed,&rdquo; and he turned round to the waiter
who was following him with the portmanteau and
asked the number of the bedroom he had engaged.</p>

<p>The man told him, and John Temple took the portmanteau
from his hand and went in the direction the
waiter indicated. When he arrived at the bedroom
door he rapped, but there was no answer. Then he
opened the door and went in, but, like the sitting-room,
he found it empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have made a mistake; this is not the room,&rdquo;
he said, sharply, to the waiter, who was still following
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, this is the bedroom you engaged,&rdquo; replied
the waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the lady&mdash;my wife is not here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; the lady in sitting-room No. 11 left the
hotel some time ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left the hotel!&rdquo; repeated John Temple, blankly.
&ldquo;Are you sure of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I saw her go down the staircase and go
out. I felt sure it was the lady from No. 11, as, if
you remember, I lit the room after the lady took ill?
And I fetched the doctor up for her also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A strange, cold feeling crept into John Temple&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you saw her go out?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; and as she passed through the hall I asked
her if she required a cab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you get her one?&rdquo; interrupted John,
hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; she just shook her head and went out; and
you&rsquo;ll excuse me, sir, mentioning it, but I thought the
lady looked very ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Went out alone! I can not understand it!&rdquo;
exclaimed John Temple; and then he once more
entered the bedroom and looked around. Could she
have left some letter, some message, he was thinking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
But there was nothing; no sign that she had been there.
After this he went back to the sitting-room, and here
he found May&rsquo;s cape lying on the floor. He had
unfastened it when she had fainted, and flung it over
the end of a couch. But her hat was gone! The
poor girl, in her despair, had never remembered her
cape, and as John Temple lifted it up a sudden fear,
a sudden anguish, struck his soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had she left him?&rdquo; he was asking himself, with
white lips. &ldquo;But surely not without some word, some
line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went up to the table; water was standing there,
and some brandy which had been brought when May
was ill, and the doctor&rsquo;s prescription. And her handkerchief
and gloves. She had forgotten these too, but
there was no letter, nor penciled note. He looked
everywhere, but it was in vain. In the short time that
he had been away she had disappeared, and the greatest
anxiety naturally filled John Temple&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>Again he recalled the waiter who had seen her leave
the hotel, but the man had nothing more to tell. Then
he himself went out and wandered restlessly up and
down the street, looking at every one he met in a miserable
state of uncertainty and doubt. He thought
once of returning to Miss Webster&rsquo;s, but no; she had
positively refused to go there, and besides she might
return at any moment. He tried to buoy himself up
with this hope, but hope grew well-nigh to despair
when hour after hour passed and there was no news
of May.</p>

<p>When the last post came in he again went out into
the streets. He inquired at the nearest cab-stand, but
no one seemed to remember anything of a lady such as
he described. He shrank from applying to the police,
and spent a night of terrible misery and remorse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not have left her,&rdquo; he moaned aloud as he
wandered up and down the sitting-room where he had
seen her last. He refused to go to bed, and more than
once went down to question the night porter. But
the gray dawn stole over the city, and the noise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
murmur of the day began, and still nothing was
seen or heard of the unhappy woman who had disappeared.</p>

<p>The first post arrived and there was no letter for
John Temple, and then he knew that May had forsaken
him. He realized this with the bitterest pain. He
recalled her words and looks before he had left her,
and suddenly&mdash;like a dagger&mdash;a memory smote him.
She had said as she lay in his arms, &ldquo;We could not
live apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God! did she go out to die then!&rdquo; burst from
John Temple&rsquo;s pale, quivering lips. The anguish of
this idea was almost too great to bear. He hesitated no
longer about going to the police. He went&mdash;a white-faced,
agitated man&mdash;to the nearest station and told
his story. His wife had disappeared from the hotel, he
said, and he was in a state of the utmost misery and
anxiety about her.</p>

<p>The inspector took notes and made certain inquiries.
&ldquo;Had he had any quarrel with the lady? Was there any
reason that she should leave him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No quarrel,&rdquo; answered John Temple, huskily, &ldquo;but
I told her some bad news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did this seem to upset her greatly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, at the time, but when I left her she was calm
and composed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she said nothing about going away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, or I should never have left her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The inspector then asked if she had any friends in
town where she was likely to take refuge, and with a
groan John Temple answered, &ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Inquiries, however, were at once commenced, and during
the day a cabman came forward and stated he had
seen the lady leave the Grosvenor Hotel, and had followed
her, hoping for a fare. That she had stopped
and beckoned to him, and that when he had asked her
where she had wished to go, that she had answered:
&ldquo;To one of the bridges.&rdquo; That he had then said, &ldquo;To
which bridge?&rdquo; and she had replied, &ldquo;Westminster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When this was repeated to John Temple he grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
ghastly pale, and staggered back, but the police inspector
tried to reassure him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No suicide had been known to have occurred from
Westminster bridge last night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and at the
time the lady had been driven there the bridge would
be crowded, and, besides, the cabman had called the
attention of a policeman to her. This policeman had
also been found, and had made a statement. He said
the cabman called his attention to a lady who had just
left his cab, and he therefore at once walked along the
bridge. He came on a gentleman speaking to a lady,
who looked very ill, and he asked the gentleman about
her, but he made a satisfactory answer, and they went
away together, and he lost sight of them. The policeman,
however, had kept looking out during the time of
his beat, and as far as was known no tragedy had happened
on the bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this cold comfort to his heart, John Temple was
forced to be content. He saw the cabman who had
driven the lady to Westminster, and from this man&rsquo;s
description John believed it had been May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had a lot of bright, light hair, all ruffled-like,&rdquo;
the cabman said, &ldquo;and a pretty, pale face, and looked
in great trouble, and had no gloves on, but he noticed
some rings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The policeman on the bridge also gave rather a similar
description of the lady he had seen talking to the
gentleman, whose arm she took before they went away.
But John Temple told himself, as he listened, that it
had not been the same. He went back to the hotel
with a bowed head and a remorseful, miserable heart.
Went back to wait in vain for news that never came.</p>

<p>And during the same day an incident occurred at
Pembridge Terrace which greatly upset both the kind
ladies there. They had been struck with John Temple&rsquo;s
manner when he parted with them the night
before, and naturally thought it strange that May
should leave home even for a few days without bidding
them good-by. And they were actually talking of this;
speculating in their mild, kindly way on the cause, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
hoping nothing had gone wrong with their young
friends, when the servant came upstairs, and having
rapped at their bedroom door told them that a gentleman
was waiting in the dining-room to see them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gentleman?&rdquo; said Miss Webster, surprised. &ldquo;Did
you ask his name, Jane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I did,&rdquo; replied Jane, &ldquo;and I think he
said Mr. Churchill, but I&rsquo;m not quite sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Churchill?&rdquo; repeated Miss Webster, and the two
sisters looked at each other in some consternation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will be down directly, Jane,&rdquo; then said Miss
Webster after a little pause, and when the maid disappeared
they again exchanged rather alarmed glances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid something has happened; that their
secret is known,&rdquo; suggested Miss Eliza, nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it will be May&rsquo;s father?&rdquo; asked Miss
Webster, as she tied her bonnet strings with trembling
fingers.</p>

<p>The two sisters were dressing themselves to go out
on a little shopping excursion when they heard of their
unexpected visitor, and they both felt very much upset.
However, there was nothing for it but to go down and
receive &ldquo;Mr. Churchill,&rdquo; whoever he might be. They
accordingly did this together, and when they entered
the dining-room they saw a tall, good-looking, middle-aged
man, with a somewhat countrified appearance,
standing there.</p>

<p>He made a bow as the sisters appeared, which they
nervously returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse my calling, ladies,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have
come to make some inquiries about my daughter, May
Churchill, who, I understand, has been living with you
for some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both the poor ladies gave a gasp, and for a moment
or two stood silent. They did not in truth know what
to say; did not know how much Mr. Churchill knew, or
how far May was committed in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My girl,&rdquo; went on Mr. Churchill, seeing their hesitation,
&ldquo;disappeared from her home some time ago,
and we have heard nothing of her till yesterday. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
yesterday I had sure information that she is living with
you, and that she is now called Mrs. John. Is this so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Webster drew herself up a little proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Churchill,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;your daughter has
been here, but she is not here at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she now, then?&rdquo; asked Mr. Churchill,
somewhat roughly. &ldquo;For I mean to find her. I have
come up to London to find her, and also to find Mr.
John Temple, who, I suppose, has taken her away if
she has gone from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again both the sisters gasped. This big strong man
seemed to overwhelm them, and they felt themselves
almost powerless in his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The long and the short of it is,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Churchill, &ldquo;I mean to call Mr. John Temple to account
for his conduct to May. He induced her, I believe, to
leave her home, and she writes to him in a manner, I
am told, that if she isn&rsquo;t married to him she ought
to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both the faded faces before him were now suffused
with a sudden blush. But a moment later Miss Webster
plucked up her courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she said, with not a little indignation in her
tone, &ldquo;I think you speak of your daughter, who is
everything that a young lady should be, in a very unbecoming
manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know, madam, what you think a young
lady should be,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Churchill; &ldquo;but I think
when a girl leaves her father&rsquo;s house, and carries on an
intrigue with a young man, that it is her father&rsquo;s duty
to learn whether she is married or not, and if she is not,
to see that she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she is married, sir!&rdquo; replied Miss Webster,
raising her head with dignity. &ldquo;I and my sister Eliza
here were present at her marriage, which was performed
by the clergyman of the parish, Mr. Mold. It
was kept a secret on account of Mr. John Temple&rsquo;s
uncle, and if it will do him any harm I hope you will
still keep it a secret, but I can positively assure you
that they are married.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s expression changed considerably while
Miss Webster was speaking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then all I can say, madam, is, that I am heartily
glad to hear it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Naturally I was put
out about my girl, and anxious to hear that it was
all right with her. However, Mr. John Temple need
not be afraid of his uncle, the squire. I saw the old
gentleman yesterday, and he told me May would be
welcomed there when his nephew brought her to the
Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, indeed, glad to hear this; indeed, most glad!&rdquo;
said Miss Webster, with a ring of genuine pleasure in
her voice. &ldquo;We have the greatest respect and regard
for Mr. John Temple, both my sister Eliza and myself,
and we have grieved a little that his marriage and your
sweet young daughter&rsquo;s should have been kept a secret.
But now it is all right. This is delightful news, is it
not, dear Eliza?&rdquo; she added, turning to her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most delightful!&rdquo; replied Miss Eliza, with emotion,
&ldquo;Really quite affecting!&rdquo; and she drew out her handkerchief
as though preparing for tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ladies, I am sure I thank you very much for
your information,&rdquo; said Mr. Churchill, heartily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
great relief to my mind; a very great relief,&rdquo; and Mr.
Churchill wiped his brow with his handkerchief. &ldquo;You
see my poor little lass lost her mother when she was
only a child, and though I&rsquo;m married again, a stepmother&rsquo;s
not the same somehow, though I&rsquo;ve nothing
to say against my missus. But about May? Where is
she now, for I would like to kiss her before I go, and
shake Mr. John Temple by the hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She left yesterday afternoon, and has gone for a
few days to the seaside with her husband,&rdquo; answered
Miss Webster. &ldquo;Mr. John Temple came yesterday and
took May away with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill looked rather puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange thing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but Mr. John Temple
would say nothing when he was questioned yesterday
whether he was married to May or not; I suppose it&rsquo;s
all right about the register, and that sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly right!&rdquo; exclaimed both sisters. &ldquo;We saw
it signed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, I think I should like to have a look at it, so if
you ladies will kindly tell me the name of the church
and the clergyman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; replied Miss Webster. &ldquo;And now,
Mr. Churchill, will you take some refreshments, and
have a glass of wine to drink to the health of the young
couple?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill accepted this hospitable offer, and
shortly afterward took his leave. But scarcely was he
gone when the sisters began to be afraid of what they
had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I hope we have done right in telling
about the marriage,&rdquo; said Miss Webster, looking at
Miss Eliza for comfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I hope so,&rdquo; replied Miss Eliza, in an
apprehensive tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you see he cast such aspersions on May?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have roused anyone to defend her&mdash;but
still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think, dear Eliza?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be as well if Mr. John Temple
knew that we were almost forced to tell the truth.
Do you think you could write to him, dear Margaret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if I knew his address. He usually stays at
the Grosvenor, but then he said they were going to-day
to the seaside, you remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he might have left his address at the Grosvenor.
I think I would try, dear Margaret. Let us ask Jane
where he directed the cab to drive to last night when
he left here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane was accordingly summoned to the dining-room,
as she had carried poor May&rsquo;s portmanteau down to the
cab when John Temple had left Pembridge Terrace
the evening before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said the Grosvenor, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;m nearly certain,&rdquo;
Jane answered to her mistress&rsquo; inquiries. So after the
maid had left the room, Miss Webster decided to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
to tell John Temple of Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s visit and its
consequences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Temple</span>,&rdquo; she began, somewhat nervously.
&ldquo;Sister Eliza and myself have been somewhat upset
this morning by receiving a visit from Mr. Churchill,
your sweet young wife&rsquo;s father. He had heard she
was living with us, and had come to seek her, and was
very anxious to learn the truth about her. And he
said some things&mdash;made some remarks&mdash;that neither
sister Eliza nor I could hear unmoved. In fact, we
were almost forced, in defense of your dear wife, to tell
him that you were married to her, and this seemed a
great relief to his mind. But we begged him still to
keep the secret, if he thought it would injure you at all
with your uncle, Mr. Temple of Woodlea Hall. But
to our great joy he told us that he had seen your
uncle on the subject, and that he had said he would
gladly welcome dear May as his nephew&rsquo;s wife. I need
not tell you how delighted we were to hear this, as Mr.
Temple&rsquo;s sanction seemed the one thing wanting to
your great happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With our united love to your dear wife, and best
regards to yourself, I remain sincerely yours.</p>

<p class="right">&rdquo;<span class="smcap">Margaret Webster.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This letter was delivered to John Temple during the
evening, as he sat alone and desolate, in his great
remorse and pain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />

<small>MR. CHURCHILL&rsquo;S NEWS.</small></h2>


<p>Early on the next morning after Ralph Webster had
left May at St. Phillip&rsquo;s Hospital, he called there to
inquire after her, and saw his friend the house surgeon,
Doctor Brentwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come to ask after the poor little woman
you brought here last night,&rdquo; said the doctor, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
shook Webster&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry to say I can&rsquo;t
give a very good account of her. She has had a bad,
restless night, and is very feverish this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; answered Webster, gravely, and a
slight quiver passed over his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She seems extremely low, almost in a hopeless
state,&rdquo; went on the doctor. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s had some tremendous
heart-break or other, poor soul; I suppose it&rsquo;s not
possible to give her any mental relief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear not,&rdquo; said Webster, in a low, pained tone.
&ldquo;She has lost at one blow all that made the happiness
of her life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doctor Brentwood looked somewhat curiously at his
friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is decidedly pretty, at least she must be even
remarkably so when she is well. I don&rsquo;t want to seem
curious, Webster, but suppose the poor young woman
gets worse&mdash;and it is possible&mdash;what other friends has
she besides yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised her faithfully not to mention anything
of her past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I presume her name&mdash;Mrs. Church&mdash;is an
assumed one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not even answer that question. But let her
have everything she can possibly require; I shall be
answerable for all the expenses connected with her
case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;you can do nothing to relieve her mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing; I only wish I could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must try to pull her through; poor young
thing, it seems a sad case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a terribly sad case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this Ralph Webster went away, but each morning
before he began his work he went to inquire at the
hospital about &ldquo;Mrs. Church.&rdquo; And May was very ill.
The shock had affected her physically as well as mentally
and she lay prostrate, hopeless, wishing the life
was ended that Webster had done his best to save.
There were times when her mind wandered, and the
fever ran high. But as a rule her great weakness was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
what the doctor feared most. It was as though the spring
of youth were broken&mdash;the flower blighted in its bloom.</p>

<p>Meanwhile as days and weeks went on naturally the
friends of the absent girl began to grow again uneasy
concerning her fate. Mr. Churchill had returned to
Woodside after his visit to London and the Misses Webster,
an elated, almost overjoyed man. He had examined
the register which recorded the marriage of John
Temple and May Churchill, and he had seen the clergyman
who had performed the ceremony. Therefore, his
mind was set at rest regarding May. He did not write
his news to his wife. He wished personally to carry it
to her, and felt a sort of secret triumph when he
remembered the remarks Mrs. Churchill had made
regarding May&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>

<p>He accordingly telegraphed to her the hour that he
hoped to arrive at home, and desired the dog-cart might
be waiting for him at the station to meet the train which
he intended to travel by. It was waiting for him, and
he was driven home, and standing at the open hall
door when he reached Woodside was his wife ready to
receive him.</p>

<p>She went quickly forward to meet him, and looked
eagerly in his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, William?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>William kissed her, but there was triumph in his
heart as he pressed his mustache against her firm lips.
He was thinking of his girl, and thinking of her with
pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything?&rdquo; half-whispered Mrs.
Churchill, as she tried to lead him into the hall. But
Mr. Churchill seemed in no hurry to impart his news.
He gave directions to the groom who had driven him
from the station regarding the horse in the dog-cart,
and inquired about another animal that was ill. Then,
at last, he turned and entered the house, and Mrs.
Churchill having closed the door behind him, followed
him into the dining-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything of May?&rdquo; she again
inquired quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Churchill, nodding his head,
while a pleased smile spread over his face; &ldquo;it is all
right; May is now Mrs. John Temple, and I saw the
register of the marriage and the clergyman who married
them myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Churchill,
genuinely astonished.</p>

<p>And for a moment or two&mdash;so strange is the human
heart&mdash;she felt a pang of disappointment at the good
news. She had always prophesied evil things of May,
and to hear that she was suddenly raised in social
position so far above herself, gave her an unpleasant
sensation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Mr. Churchill, somewhat boastfully,
&ldquo;my girl has done well for herself, hasn&rsquo;t she,
Sarah? I went first to the ladies where she lived after
she left here, until she married Mr. John Temple. They
were two real ladies, clergyman&rsquo;s daughters, and
elderly, and had known Mr. John Temple for years,
and he asked them to take charge of her until he could
make her his wife. And you should have heard how
they spoke of her, in the highest terms, and they went
to the church when she was married, and so it&rsquo;s all on
the square.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why was there all this secrecy?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Churchill, for she had not yet got over her chagrin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems he thought the old squire and madam
wouldn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; answered Mr. Churchill. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s
all right now, for the squire himself told me he
would welcome May as his nephew&rsquo;s wife. And as
for madam, well, madam will just have to take it as
best as she can. My girl will step into her shoes
when the old gentleman dies, for the Hall goes to
the heir I&rsquo;m told, and I&rsquo;ll have my son-in-law for
my landlord&mdash;but I was always proud and fond of
May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Churchill composed her lips and tried to swallow
her mortification. But after all she was a sensible,
though a hard woman, and she saw it was no use trying
to throw cold water on her husband&rsquo;s elation at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
good fortune of his daughter. She therefore went up
to him and kissed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am glad it has ended
well, and that you are pleased. But you have forgotten
to let me know one thing; did you see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; as ill-luck would have it, Mr. John Temple had
taken her away to the seaside for a few days, and she
was out of London when I was there. But I expect we
shall be hearing from her shortly; and to-morrow morning
I&rsquo;ll go over to the Hall and see the squire, and tell
him the news. Ay, and in spite of madam, I expect
we&rsquo;ll be having her staying at the Hall in no time, and
what will you think of that, Sarah?&rdquo; And Mr.
Churchill laughed aloud, and patted his wife&rsquo;s comely
chin.</p>

<p>This was, however, a little more than Mrs. Churchill&rsquo;s
temper could bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope it will end well,&rdquo; she said, tartly;
&ldquo;unequal marriages rarely do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s so unequal,&rdquo; retorted Mr.
Churchill. &ldquo;What was madam herself, who holds her
head so high? Only a poor parson&rsquo;s daughter, with a
skin-flint mother, who begs for milk and eggs of everyone
who is fool enough to give her them. My girl is
as good as madam any day, and as for looks there&rsquo;s no
doubt May has the best of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too uplifted, William,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
Churchill, reproachfully; &ldquo;remember pride may have a
fall.&rdquo; And having administered this rebuke, Mrs.
Churchill left the room, leaving her husband seriously
offended.</p>

<p>He was indeed so offended that he would not speak
again on the subject during the whole evening. But
early the next morning he ordered his best horse to be
saddled, as he thought it behooved him to make a good
appearance on such an important occasion as carrying
the news of his nephew&rsquo;s marriage to the squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to ride over to the Hall, Sarah,&rdquo; he said,
as he rose from the breakfast table, and he felt as he
spoke that he was master of the situation. And Sarah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
felt this too. It was disagreeable that this little &ldquo;chit&rdquo;
should be raised above her, but Mrs. Churchill knew
very well it was true. Her property consisted of one
good farm, besides some savings of her first husband.
But what was this to the large estates of the squire&rsquo;s of
Woodlea? And Mr. John Temple was heir to these
estates, and May was his wife. So Mrs. Churchill had
made up her mind to make the best of it. She had also
offended her good-looking husband, and Mrs. Churchill
did not like being on bad terms with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, my dear,&rdquo; she therefore answered
meekly, to her spouse&rsquo;s announcement that he was
going to the Hall, &ldquo;and I am glad you have such good
news to tell the squire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is good news,&rdquo; replied Mr. Churchill, still stiffly;
but he felt mollified, and deigned to kiss his hand to
his wife, as she stood at the hall door and watched him
mount his good horse and ride away.</p>

<p>And it was no doubt with an uplifted heart that Mr.
Churchill rode on his errand to the Hall. He knew,
indeed, that Mr. Temple&rsquo;s approval, or disapproval,
would ultimately make no difference to John Temple&rsquo;s
position. The estates were strictly entailed on the next
heir, in the event of the squire dying without children.
The one child of the house was dead, and John Temple
was the next heir, therefore the Woodlea property
must some day be his, and his children&rsquo;s after him.
Mr. Churchill looked proudly around, as he went on, at
the wide grass-lands and wooded slopes of the familiar
landscape. He seemed to see them in a new light.
His grandson might become their possessor, and he, the
grandsire, would no doubt reap the benefit. He was
a man who loved money and success in life, but to give
him his due he was also not thinking only of worldly
advantages. He was thinking that no one could now
throw a stone at his &ldquo;little girl, and that she would be
able to hold up her head with the best of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And his heart was still full of pride when he drew
rein at the Hall. He could scarcely ask if he could see
the squire in the same tone as was his wont. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
tried to do this, and not to show any undue elation,
when the squire received him in the library.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Churchill, have you any news?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Temple, gravely, as he held out his hand to his
tenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, squire, I have,&rdquo; answered Mr. Churchill, cordially
grasping his landlord&rsquo;s hand in his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Temple, somewhat
nervously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I went up to London, as you know, the
day before yesterday, and yesterday morning I went to
the house in Pembridge Terrace, Bayswater, where the
ladies live whose address Mrs. Temple kindly gave me,
and where my daughter May has been staying since
she left her home. And, squire, I found two real ladies,
elderly, and clergyman&rsquo;s daughters, and they seemed
very fond of my girl, and had known your nephew, Mr.
John Temple, for many years. And to make a long
story short, squire, Mr. John Temple and May were
married from their house; the ladies going to the
church to witness the ceremony, and then the young
people went abroad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Temple&rsquo;s delicate, rather pallid complexion
slightly flushed at this announcement, and for a
moment he was silent. The pride of birth and station
were not absent from his nature, but, on the other
hand, he was a good and just man, and he knew that
John Temple had only acted rightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Churchill,&rdquo; he said, rather slowly, &ldquo;I am
glad to hear this is so. If my nephew induced your
daughter to leave her home, he has only done what a
gentleman ought to do in making her his wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She left her home to become his wife, sir,&rdquo; answered
Mr. Churchill, rather quickly. &ldquo;That was the arrangement
between them, and in the meanwhile my girl
went to these ladies, who are friends of his, and
remained with them until her marriage. And that
there might be no doubt about it, squire, I went to the
church where they were married, and I saw the clergyman
who married them, and examined the register;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and this&mdash;&rdquo; and he drew a sheet of paper from his
pocket-book as he spoke&mdash;&ldquo;this is the copy of the
register of their marriage, and if you&rsquo;ll kindly look at
it you will see it&rsquo;s all on the square.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The squire settled his gold-rimmed glasses on his
nose, and took the paper in his hand. In it were duly
set forth the date and other particulars of the marriage
of John Temple and May Churchill, or rather of Margaret
Alice Churchill, for May had given her full
baptismal name on the occasion of her marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. Temple read the copy through and then returned
it to Mr. Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, there is no mistake, Mr. Churchill,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and we must earnestly hope that the young
people may be happy together. Your daughter, from
what I have seen of her, is, I am sure, a charming and
very pretty girl&mdash;and I will write to my nephew to
congratulate him. But where are they now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I am sorry to say I missed them. Mr.
John Temple had taken May away to the seaside for a
few days when I arrived in town. But no doubt we
will be hearing from them soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The squire looked rather puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was strange,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my nephew would
say nothing before he left here. However, there is no
doubt about their marriage, and when you hear from
your daughter, Mr. Churchill, will you let me know,
and then I will write to my nephew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will, sir,&rdquo; answered Mr. Churchill; &ldquo;and
thank you kindly for the way in which you have spoken
of my girl. You might have looked higher, naturally,
for your nephew, but this I will say for my daughter
May&mdash;that a sweeter or bonnier lass does not live!
There&rsquo;s no vice about her, sir, and she&rsquo;s been a blessing
and a comfort to me always, and I&rsquo;m sure she will be
one to her husband. Her mother was a lady&mdash;a
clergyman&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;and May has taken after her
in all her ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is no doubt a very sweet-looking girl,&rdquo; said the
squire, &ldquo;and I shall be glad to welcome her here. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
now I am afraid I must say good-morning, Mr. Churchill,
as I have an engagement I must keep.&rdquo; And the squire
looked at his watch.</p>

<p>Upon this hint Mr. Churchill took his departure, and
scarcely was he gone when Mr. Temple proceeded at
once to the breakfast-room, where he had left his handsome
wife.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple was listlessly reading the newspaper,
and she looked up somewhat surprised when he entered
the room, as she did not know of Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have got some news for you, Rachel,&rdquo; said Mr.
Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;News?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Temple, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; John Temple is married to Miss Churchill;
must have married her two days after he left here in
the autumn, when he said he went to Paris&mdash;that must
have been his wedding trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple started to her feet, and her face flushed
and then grew pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this possible?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Churchill has just been here, and he brought
with him a copy of the register of their marriage.
There can be no mistake, and yet I do not understand
John&rsquo;s conduct, or why he was so reticent about it,
when I distinctly told him that if he had induced her
to leave her home that it was his duty to make her his
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something to hide, something he is keeping
back!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Temple, excitedly. &ldquo;But you
say they are actually married?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are certainly married, and Rachel, now that
the thing is done, we must try to make the best of it.
Naturally it is not what I wished for John&mdash;still&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think not!&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Temple,
scornfully. &ldquo;A tenant farmer&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;truly her
pretty face has made her fortune!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is done, and when I hear from John I mean
to write to him; after all the girl is good and pretty,
and he might have done worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not well, I think,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple, bitterly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
and then she left the room, full of excitement and
anger.</p>

<p>The news of John Temple&rsquo;s marriage was indeed
very bitter to her. Unconsciously she had learnt to
like him too well for one thing, and for another she disliked,
nay hated, the whole Churchill family. The boys
had played in the fatal game when her little son was
killed, and she had always felt a strange jealousy of
May&rsquo;s beauty. And now she was Mrs. John Temple,
the wife of the heir of Woodlea! reflected Mrs. Temple,
with curling lips.</p>

<p>But she was too much excited to keep the news to
herself. She therefore hastily put on her hat and cloak,
and started for the vicarage to tell her mother. She
felt a sort of grim pleasure in thinking what a rage
Mrs. Layton would be in when she heard it. And she
certainly was not disappointed in this. Her arrival
was most unexpected and inconvenient, for she rarely
went to her father&rsquo;s house, and on this unfortunate
morning Mrs. Layton was engaged in what she called
&ldquo;dressing her feathers,&rdquo; that is, all the feathers that
she could collect from the fowls eaten at the Hall or at
the vicarage were eagerly saved and stored away by
Mrs. Layton until she had acquired a sufficient quantity
to have a grand assortment of them. She was therefore
sitting covered with feathers in her store-room,
when she was told that her daughter, Mrs. Temple, was
waiting below to see her.</p>

<p>She tried to shake herself free of the feathers, but
with many still clinging to her hair and dress she
finally descended, by no means in a good humor. Mrs.
Temple was standing looking out of the window as
she entered the room, and she gave rather a hard
laugh when she saw her mother&rsquo;s extraordinary appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever have you been doing?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dressing my feathers, my dear,&rdquo; replied
Mrs. Layton, &ldquo;my half-yearly dressing, you know, and
I don&rsquo;t believe, Rachel, that your cook or your scullery-maid
have sent me half what they should.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Temple slightly shrugged her handsome shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a wedding in the family,&rdquo; she said, scornfully,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve come to tell you the news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wedding!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Layton, blankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my nephew John Temple has entered the distinguished
family of Churchill,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Temple,
yet more scornfully. &ldquo;Nice for us all, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true?&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Layton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly true, I assure you! The respected head
of the family has just been to the Hall to tell Phillip,
and he brought a copy of the register of the marriage,
and everything is all correct. My beloved nephew, it
seems, was secretly married when he went away in the
autumn, he said, to Paris. No doubt he did go to Paris,
but it was with his highly-born bride!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever is the world coming to!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Layton with uplifted hands. &ldquo;It will be destroyed&mdash;no
doubt the end is coming&mdash;such monstrous things
occur! To think that this girl, a girl I&rsquo;ve bought eggs
of, a girl whose character I consider to be far from
what it ought to be, should make such a match! But
I warned you, Rachel, against John Temple; a snake in
the grass, I considered him; but I never thought he would
be such a fool as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he must be more a fool than a snake,&rdquo;
answered Mrs. Temple, contemptuously. &ldquo;Fancy
marrying a girl like this! And Phillip says we must
make the best of it, which I suppose means inviting
the bride and bridegroom to stay at the Hall! However,
we shall see. But, good-morning now, mother;
I&rsquo;ll leave you to digest my news.&rdquo; And with a little
nod Mrs. Temple turned away and left the house, while
Mrs. Layton stood absolutely speechless with disgust.</p>

<p>But both Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s elation and Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s
indignation cooled down during the next few weeks.
For, to the great surprise and disappointment of Mr.
Churchill, nothing was heard at Woodside either from
John Temple or his supposed bride. Each morning
Mr. Churchill said he could not understand it when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
letters came in and there was none from May; and
Mrs. Churchill&mdash;though with caution&mdash;began again to
insinuate that she feared it was not all right. And the
squire himself, just a week after Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s visit
to the Hall to announce the marriage, walked one
morning over to Woodside, to ask Mr. Churchill the
whereabouts of the bride and bridegroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, squire, it&rsquo;s the strangest thing, but we have
not had a word from them,&rdquo; answered Mr. Churchill,
somewhat disconcerted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is certainly very strange,&rdquo; said the squire, slowly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t understand it, because I told the ladies&mdash;the
Miss Websters that she had been staying with, and who
saw her married to Mr. John Temple&mdash;that you had
been kind enough to say you would receive her as his
wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which I certainly shall do. Well, Mr. Churchill,
why not write to these ladies and ask if they know
their address? They probably do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that, sir; but I&rsquo;ll write to them
this very day. Thank you very much for thinking of
it, squire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mr. Churchill accordingly did write to Miss
Webster, and after apologizing for troubling her, told
her that he was getting anxious at not hearing from his
daughter, and asked her to be good enough to give him
Mrs. John Temple&rsquo;s address, if she knew it. And he
added, &ldquo;Mr. Temple, the squire of Woodlea, was here
this morning, and will be glad also to hear from his
nephew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An answer to this letter was most anxiously expected
at Woodside, and after two days one came, which was
as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I am sorry I can not give you the information
you require regarding the address of Mr. and
Mrs. John Temple, as we have heard nothing from them
since the day Mr. John Temple arrived here and took
your daughter away for a proposed short visit to the
seaside. But the same day that you called and told us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
Mr. Temple of Woodlea Hall would be glad to receive
the young people, I felt it was my pleasing duty to
write a few lines to Mr. John Temple to tell him of
your visit, and also of his uncle&rsquo;s sanction to his marriage.
I sent this letter to the Grosvenor Hotel, where
he sometimes stays while in town, but I have received
no reply. And therefore we&mdash;my sister and myself&mdash;can
only conclude that Mr. and Mrs. John Temple must
have gone abroad, and have not received my letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trusting, however, that you will soon hear from
them, I remain,</p>

<p class="signoff">&ldquo;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">&rdquo;<span class="smcap">Margaret Webster</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it; no doubt they are abroad,&rdquo; said Mr.
Churchill, after he had read Miss Webster&rsquo;s letter, handing
it to his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, they may be,&rdquo; replied his wife.</p>

<p>But Mr. Churchill was quite sure that they were, and
took over Miss Webster&rsquo;s letter to show it to the squire.
But the squire still thought it very strange, and so did
Mrs. Temple when her husband told her of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something to hide. John Temple is keeping
something back,&rdquo; she said. And she thought again
and again, &ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.<br />

<small>KATHLEEN WEIR&rsquo;S GHOST.</small></h2>


<p>And during this time, also, Miss Kathleen Weir had
felt very much disappointed that she had neither seen
nor heard anything of Mr. Ralph Webster. That is, she
only received two brief notes from him, both declining
her invitations to &ldquo;a merry supper after the play to meet
Linda Falconer, as you admired her so much&mdash;and her
swain, Dereham.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>But Webster, with the ever-present memory of that
despairing face on the bridge, and the constant anxiety
for the unhappy girl lying in St. Phillip&rsquo;s Hospital, nigh
unto death, had felt it was impossible for him to
encounter the gay and lively sallies of the actress.
Not that he had lost interest in the woman who stood
between poor May and happiness, but his mind was too
much out of tune to go into such vivacious company,
and he therefore had refused Miss Weir&rsquo;s invitations.</p>

<p>But nearly three weeks after he had taken May
Churchill to St. Phillip&rsquo;s, a change came over her condition.
Her physical health decidedly improved, and one
morning when Doctor Brentwood was paying his usual
visit to her she spoke to him of her future life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to live now, doctor, am I not?&rdquo; she said,
in a low, pained tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly you are going to live,&rdquo; replied the doctor.
&ldquo;I hope for many years; until you are quite old,&rdquo; and
he smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be a long time,&rdquo; said May, with a weary
sigh; &ldquo;I am not much past twenty now&mdash;a long, long
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems long to look forward to, but time passes
quickly enough, especially when it is fully employed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is about this that I meant to speak to you of,
doctor,&rdquo; continued May, and a faint color stole to her
pale cheeks. &ldquo;If I am going to live I must do something
to gain my own living; I must find some employment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone is better employed,&rdquo; answered the doctor,
cheerfully; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good for mind and body alike. Now
what do you think you would like to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since I have felt a little better I have thought of
this constantly. I&mdash;I should like to see Mr. Webster
about it, as he might be able to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure he will do anything to help you; he is
your sincere friend, and has been most anxious about
you during your illness, and has called each morning to
inquire for you. Therefore you may depend on his
assistance, I am certain, and, I may add, on mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very good&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I am going to ask you a question which
is not a medical one,&rdquo; interrupted the doctor, &ldquo;and,
therefore you need not answer it unless you like. But
have you no friends, no relations, to whom you can now
apply?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None!&rdquo; answered May, with sudden emotion; &ldquo;I
wish to be as one dead to everyone I know&mdash;they must
think me dead, and I would have been, but for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me for having pained you, and I will promise
never again to allude to the subject. So you would
like to see Ralph Webster? Well, you shall see him
to-morrow, and I am truly glad to find you so much
better.&rdquo; And then he smiled kindly and went away.</p>

<p>He felt interested in this forlorn and broken-hearted
young woman, who he was sure his friend Webster had
saved from some tragic fate; and not the less interested
on account of May&rsquo;s fair face. He therefore wrote to
Webster during the day, and told him of the improvement
in May&rsquo;s health, and also of her wish to find some
employment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw cold water on this, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he
added; &ldquo;it will be the very best thing possible for her,
and will give her an interest in life which she has well-nigh
lost. Can you call to-morrow afternoon?&rdquo; And so
forth.</p>

<p>Doctor Brentwood&rsquo;s letter was a great relief to Webster&rsquo;s
mind, and he received another by the same post
from Miss Kathleen Weir. This was a highly characteristic
epistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Webster</span>: For the third and last time,
unless you come, will you take supper with me this
evening; or if suits you better will you call in the afternoon?
Wire which. Yours ever sincerely.</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Kathleen Weir.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster read this note with a smile; thought it over,
and then decided to call during the afternoon, and he
accordingly telegraphed Miss Weir to that effect. And
as he drove to the actress&rsquo; flat he was wondering if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
she had any news to tell him, and he found that she had
some.</p>

<p>She received him in her usual airy fashion, and she
was charmingly dressed in a most becoming tea-gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you have come at last,&rdquo; she said, holding out
her hand as Webster entered her drawing-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, taking it, &ldquo;and I should have
come before, but I have been a good deal worried of
late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About money or love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About neither, as it happens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought there were only two things worried men,
and the want of money was the worst. Well, we must
all have it; but I have been more than worried, I have
been upset; I have seen a ghost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ghost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the ghost of a dead love! There, can you guess
what I mean? Well, I suppose not, so I must tell you.
But I have really been shocked; I have seen John Temple
in the flesh, though looking so awfully ill that he
was much more like a dead man than a living one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you see him?&rdquo; asked Webster, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you. Yesterday morning I drove down to
see Mr. Harrison, the solicitor, as I wanted to be quite
certain whether John Temple is the man who has come
into the fortune, as Dereham was so positive that he
was. Well, you know Harrison&rsquo;s offices are at Westminster,
and I saw the old boy sure enough, but he
was as sly as a fox. He did not deny that John Temple
was the man &lsquo;that ultimately, mind ultimately, my
dear madam,&rsquo; he kept repeating, would succeed to his
uncle&rsquo;s estate or estates. &lsquo;But his position at present is
unchanged,&rsquo; he added, and he threw ice on my suggestion
that I should have an increased allowance. &lsquo;When
Mr. John Temple succeeds to the property the question
can then be mooted,&rsquo; and so on. In fact I got no satisfaction
for my trouble, and when I came out of the
office in a very bad humor I told the cabman to drive
over Westminster bridge and back again, as I thought
the river air might improve my temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you went?&rdquo; asked Webster, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went; I was in a hansom, and when we got to the
other end of the bridge I told the man to turn back.
He did so, and there was a block as we re-crossed, and
I was bending out of the cab to see what was going to
happen, when my eyes fell on the figure of a man leaning
on the parapet of the bridge, and staring into the
river below. As I was looking at him, he lifted his head
and looked around, and I saw a ghost&mdash;the ghost of John
Temple! But, oh, so horribly changed! He looked
haggard, worn, and old, and a sort of pity&mdash;such fools
are women&mdash;crept into my heart as I looked at him. I
felt sorry for him; I thought he must be in some terrible
trouble, and so I felt I should like to speak to him.
I pulled out my handkerchief and waved it to attract
his attention, and someone told him of this, for he
looked quickly up at the cab, and our eyes met! I
wish you had seen the look of horror that came over
his face, of shuddering horror, as he recognized me. It
was hatred! He glared at me just for a moment, and
then turned and fled as if the devil himself were after
him. There, what do you think of that? The end of a
dead love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is very dramatic,&rdquo; said Ralph Webster,
slowly. He forced himself to speak the commonplace
words, but he was not thinking commonplace thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, there was something in this man&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; went
on the actress, &ldquo;that told me a story. John Temple is
grieving about something that has cut his heart-strings.
It can&rsquo;t be money in his case because for one thing he
never cared very much about it, and for another he will
ultimately, as Mr. Harrison described it, succeed to his
uncle&rsquo;s property, and with such prospects he could borrow
as much as he liked, I suppose. No, it is about
some woman! He was looking down into the dusky
river when I first saw him. Can he have driven some
poor soul to seek for refuge in its gloomy depths?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Webster inwardly shuddered, but Kathleen
Weir little thought how near she was to the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is miserable about some woman,&rdquo; she repeated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
&ldquo;and that is why I have sent for you to-day. I am in
the way, I suppose, and I don&rsquo;t want to be in the way
any longer. I want to be free, and of course he does.
Now, how can I find out about his life, for if I could
find out, I expect I could go triumphantly through the
ordeal of the divorce court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster was silent for a few moments; he was thinking
the knowledge of John Temple&rsquo;s second marriage
would not free him from his first. It would bring disgrace
to him, but not liberty to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would have to show a case against him besides
this supposed woman,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;Did he ever
treat you cruelly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean did he ever punch my head, or pull my
hair?&rdquo; answered Kathleen, with a hard, little laugh.
&ldquo;No, I can not truthfully say he ever did; but I might
say it untruthfully, and he would be too glad to get rid
of me to contradict me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it would be very dangerous; you would have
to prove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events he forsook me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you parted by mutual consent?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How horrid you are, Mr. Webster! At all events I
mean to get quit of him. I am weary of a tie which is
no tie; of a bond which galls me, and I would do anything,
even something desperate, to break it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started to her feet, and began walking up and
down the room as she spoke, swaying her tall, fine
figure with a restless movement as she did so. She
was looking very handsome, her excitement had flushed
her face and brightened her bright eyes, and involuntarily
Webster admired her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, presently, &ldquo;now I have told you
my news, so please rouse your sharp legal brains to
help me. I don&rsquo;t mind about the three hundred a year
now, or the ultimate reversion of some bigger sum. I
want to be free. I don&rsquo;t want John Temple to cut his
own throat or mine&mdash;and upon my word he looked as
if he could do it&mdash;but I want to scrape out of my marriage
some other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let me have time to think it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, and now let us drop a disagreeable subject,
and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all
this long time? You look thinner, and you say you
have been worried?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; we all have worries and troubles, you know,
Miss Weir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true; but still I think life might be bright,
might be sweet and worth living for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure yours is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t pay me those commonplace compliments;
I don&rsquo;t want to hear them from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You despise my best efforts to be agreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a disagreeable humor you are in! I declare
I think I shall send you away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, must I go?&rdquo; said Webster, rising with a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet; unless you will promise to come again
very soon. Come to supper to meet Linda Falconer
and Dereham the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see if I can, if you will allow the invitation to
remain open. By the by, how is that affair progressing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, swimmingly, I believe, but Linda is fearfully
bored with him. &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; she said to me the other
day, &lsquo;he is too silly.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor boy, indeed! However, that is settled, and
you will come the day after to-morrow to supper? In
the meantime, you know, don&rsquo;t forget my ghost and his
probable misdoings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Webster with a laugh. Then he
took leave of the actress, and Kathleen Weir was
alone.</p>

<p>As she had done once before after he had left her,
she immediately went up to one of the mirrors in the
room and gazed at her own reflection in the glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I so weak?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Do I actually like
this man, perhaps better than he likes me? But if I
were free I think he would like me&mdash;I must be free!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />

<small>BY THE SEA.</small></h2>


<p>The next day Ralph Webster went to see a very different
woman to the sprightly actress. He went to see
pale, sad-faced May Churchill, propped up in an easy
chair, with the unmistakable attitudes of weakness and
languor in every movement.</p>

<p>A sudden flush, however, rose to her very brows as
Webster entered the room, and she nervously held out
her hand. She was remembering that momentous meeting
on the bridge; remembering her terrible misery and
despair.</p>

<p>And the ordinarily calm Webster was also ill at ease.
He took the thin, trembling little hand in his, almost
without a word; he looked at the altered face, and a
strange, painful emotion stirred his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are better?&rdquo; he said a moment later, but not
in his usual firm tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, much better,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>It was the same sweet, low voice that he had listened
for too eagerly at his aunts&rsquo; house; that had touched
some hidden chord in his heart that hitherto had been
mute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Brentwood told me you were much better,&rdquo;
he went on, still nervously, &ldquo;and I hope soon to see you
quite well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May made no reply for a moment or so, then she
looked up in his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did Doctor Brentwood tell you anything else?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;Did he tell you that I wish to find some
employment at once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told me something of this,&rdquo; answered Webster,
taking a chair and drawing it nearer to her; &ldquo;but for
you to do anything at once is, I am sure, impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must, indeed I must, Mr. Webster,&rdquo; said May,
earnestly. &ldquo;I can not any longer be a burden to you&mdash;I
know I have been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>Here she paused, and tears came unbidden into her
eyes, and she turned away her head to hide her emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not, I entreat you, speak thus,&rdquo; said Webster,
also much moved. &ldquo;I have only been too happy, too
thankful, to have been of any use to you. And anything
I can do for you, anything that a most sincere
friend can do, I am sure you know I will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been most kind, most good,&rdquo; faltered May.
&ldquo;But&mdash;but do not let us speak of the painful past; it
upsets me, and unfits me for what I have got to say, for
what I must do. What I want is to find some work,
some employment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what have you thought of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought of many things,&rdquo; answered May with
a wan smile. &ldquo;I am not sufficiently educated to be a
governess, I fear, for I have never been at any college
nor passed examinations as they do now. I could go
into a shop&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; interrupted Webster, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? It is a means of livelihood, and what
matter is it?&rdquo; said May, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a life you are quite unsuited for, and one utterly
unsuited to you. That is out of the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there are telegraph and post office clerks, are
there not, who are women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Webster, I must do something. And&mdash;there
is another thing I have thought of&mdash;what I should like
best, I think&mdash;to be a nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean a hospital nurse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, like Nurse Margaret, who has attended upon
me. I am sure I should like this best, and if Doctor
Brentwood would give me a chance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure he will do anything for you that he can.
Yes,&rdquo; continued Webster, after a moment&rsquo;s thought,
&ldquo;I think that life would suit you best. You are naturally
gentle and kind, and to help poor, sick people
would be a congenial task to you. But nursing, like
other things, has to be taught. I will talk to Brentwood
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, they receive what they call probationers at some
hospitals, and perhaps Doctor Brentwood would kindly
use his influence to get me admitted at one of these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see about it, and I think it is the most likely
thing to suit you. But before you do anything, or
think of anything, you must have a complete change of
air. You must go to the seaside for awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not do this, Mr. Webster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me saying so, but you must. Nothing will
make you strong but that. How could you nurse anyone
when you still want nursing yourself? You must
go to Hastings, or one of these places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have no money to do so&mdash;it is impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I not asked you to regard me as a sincere
friend? Do you think the trifle it would cost is not
most heartily at your service? When you become a
very swell nurse, you know,&rdquo; added Webster, smiling
and trying to speak lightly, &ldquo;you must repay me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if I only could,&rdquo; said May, with emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can, and will. Now that is all settled, and tell
me where would you like to go&mdash;Hastings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Webster&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of person has waited on you here? A
nice woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very nice woman, Nurse Margaret, Sister Margaret,
they call her. She has been so good to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you shall go to Hastings with Sister Margaret
to take care of you. And I shall expect to see quite a
rosy face when I go down to see you. And now I am
not going to stay any longer to-day and tire you. We
have settled that you are to become a nurse, but first
you must get quite well. I will see Brentwood and
make all arrangements. For the present, good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held out his hand, which May took tremulously.
She dare not ask him any questions, nor even inquire
after his aunts. She knew if she did she would break
down, and he knew this also. They both ignored the
past, or at least did not speak of it.</p>

<p>And when she next saw Doctor Brentwood after this
interview with Ralph Webster, he told her that everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
was settled. She was to go to Hastings in three
days, and Sister Margaret, the hospital nurse, was to
accompany her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when you return I will see about receiving
you here as a probationer,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;as Webster
tells me you wish to become a nurse. Would you
rather stay here, or go to another hospital?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should rather stay here if I may,&rdquo; answered May,
gratefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can manage it. Yes, the sea-cure is the
very thing for you, and I expect you will come back
quite well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but, Doctor Brentwood, about the expense?
I can not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor moved his well-shaped hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all settled,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you trouble
your head about anything. Sister Margaret has instructions
to arrange everything for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And May found that Sister Margaret had instructions
to go out and purchase everything she required in the
way of dress or outfit. She was a nice, kind, sensible
woman, whose own brow was not unlined with sorrow,
and she felt great pity for the poor young widow&mdash;so
May was supposed to be in the hospital&mdash;whom she
had nursed through her grievous illness. She was also
instructed to ask Mrs. Church no questions regarding
her past life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has had great troubles; let her try to forget
them,&rdquo; the doctor told the nurse. &ldquo;She has youth to
help her, and thinking of the past will do her no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Webster saw May again before she left town
for Hastings, but when she tried to thank him for all
he had done for her he would not listen. To do anything
for her indeed was his greatest happiness. But
he tried to hide this, and did hide the strong, deep feelings
of his heart.</p>

<p>But a painful incident occurred before he parted with
her. Webster noticed that May was agitated, and suddenly
her delicate skin flushed, and with quivering lips
she asked him a question:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you,&rdquo; she said, in a broken voice, &ldquo;seen or
heard anything of&mdash;him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster hesitated, but he saw it was only cruel to
prolong her suspense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard nothing,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;of Mr.
Temple; except I know a person who saw him one
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he is still in London!&rdquo; cried May, with deep
emotion; &ldquo;still&mdash;he must have made inquiries&mdash;he&mdash;he
was sure to make inquiries&mdash;but no doubt he
believes me dead. It is best that he should believe me
dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She suddenly broke down and burst into passionate
sobs. In vain Webster entreated her to try and compose
herself. It seemed as though the flood-gate of
her emotion was let loose, and the long strain of silence
broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am dead!&rdquo; she kept on repeating; &ldquo;dead to every
one; no one knows I live but you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you pain me so deeply,&rdquo; said Webster, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; sobbed May, &ldquo;but I thought I would
ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush! try not to think of all this. A new
life is opening to you; try to go into it with a brave
heart. Believe me, there is nothing like work; it
deadens pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an irrepressible ring of sadness in his
voice as he said the last words, which told of his own
hard struggle, the struggle of which May knew nothing.
But something in his voice made her dry her
tears and look at him. He was very pale, and his face
had grown thinner and more marked, she noticed, and
her heart reproached her for adding to his troubles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me for being so selfish,&rdquo; she said, gently;
&ldquo;I&mdash;will not give way any more. But have you been
ill? You do not look very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been too hard-worked, I suppose,&rdquo; answered
Webster, trying to smile. &ldquo;I shall go down to Hastings
for a day&rsquo;s holiday while you are there, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
will freshen me up. And now, is there anything else I
can do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing indeed! You have only been too
good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all right then, and now good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stooped down as he spoke and pressed his lips
upon her hand, and then turned quickly away. And
May looked after him gratefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How good he is!&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;what a noble heart
he has! I wonder what made him look so sad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But a few minutes later Sister Margaret bustled into
the room, and she, also, was full of Mr. Webster&rsquo;s
praise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a thorough gentleman he is!&rdquo; she said, quite
enthusiastically. &ldquo;Have you known him long, Mrs.
Church?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For some time,&rdquo; answered May, and her tone
reminded Sister Margaret she had been instructed to
ask Mrs. Church no questions regarding her past life.</p>

<p>Yet the good woman naturally felt curious, and had
decided in her own mind that Mr. Webster must have
been an old lover of the young widow&rsquo;s, and she began
to hope that it might end in a marriage. This was, of
course, entirely her own theory, for she had certainly
nothing to go on. For she and May were quite a fortnight
at Hastings before they either saw or heard anything
more of Mr. Webster.</p>

<p>She took comfortable rooms for May overlooking the
sea, and the change of scene and fresh air soon began
to revive the drooping invalid. And a strange change
came over May&rsquo;s mind also at this time. Sister Margaret
had many a sad tale to tell her; tales of forsaken
wives and broken hearts. Her experience of life had
not lain along its smooth paths. She had trod the
rough roads, and the sick and sorrowful had been her
daily companions. And listening to her May began to
learn that her case was not worse than others; her
wound not more terrible than some of her fellow
sufferers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I loved him too much,&rdquo; she told herself; &ldquo;it blinded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
me, and I believed he loved me as I loved him. But it
was not the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not even give John Temple his due, for he had
not felt for her a brief passion that soon would pass away.
He had loved her with a selfish love, no doubt, but with
a love that made him put everything else aside for her
sake. He thought, also, that she cared for him beyond
and above all earthly things; that nothing would have
torn her from his side.</p>

<p>She had not realized the shock, the horror of her
awakening. It seemed to end everything for her, and
now slowly struggling back to life, she told herself that
John Temple had never really loved her. She had been
his plaything; his &ldquo;country sweetheart,&rdquo; as he had often
called her in his fond hours of love.</p>

<p>Sitting watching the long, rolling waves breaking up
against the white cliffs, or the sea-birds winging their
way above the foam, May told herself again and again
that her life was done&mdash;that is, her life of happiness
and hope. There remained but for her a cold and colorless
existence, toiling for her daily bread. Yet she did
not shrink from her fate. She accepted it as inevitable,
and, after the first bitterness was passed, bore herself
with a certain amount of heroism and calmness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was mad that night, and but for Mr. Webster&mdash;&rdquo; she
sometimes thought, and would shudder as she did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder he has never been down to see us?&rdquo; at last
one day said Sister Margaret, at the very moment when
May was vaguely thinking of the past.</p>

<p>The two were sitting together on the pier, in a bright,
fresh day in the early winter time, when Sister Margaret
made this remark. All around them was the deep
blue sea, white-crested and sparkling in the sun. Visitors
were strolling about, and the whole scene was
cheerful and invigorating. May roused herself from
her sad day-dreams to answer Sister Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Mr. Webster?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I dare say he
is too busy to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked up as she spoke, looked across the pier,
and with a little start the next moment she recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
Ralph Webster. He was leaning back against the railing
watching the two women he had come to see, and
when his eyes met May&rsquo;s he raised his hat and crossed
over to speak to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Mr. Webster!&rdquo; cried Sister Margaret,
when she saw him. &ldquo;What a start you gave us! we
were just speaking of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you?&rdquo; he answered, and he shook hands with
them both, and then sat down by May&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I sit beside you?&rdquo; he said, as he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been wondering,&rdquo; he went on the next
moment, smiling, &ldquo;how long I should stand opposite to
you without your seeing me? Do you know I&rsquo;ve been
quite five minutes over there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said May. She felt nervous and agitated.
Seeing him again so suddenly had brought the past
more vividly before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have not been wasting my time,&rdquo; continued
Webster, still smiling; &ldquo;I have been seeing, and with
great and sincere pleasure, how much you are improved.
The sea air has made a wonderful difference in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; doesn&rsquo;t she look well?&rdquo; said Sister Margaret,
proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed she does. This is a charming day,&rdquo; went on
Webster, looking up at the blue sky, and then down at
the blue sea. &ldquo;It seems like a rest to sit here; a rest
from the worries of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have you been very busy?&rdquo; asked May, half-shyly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always work fairly hard, you know,&rdquo; answered
Webster.</p>

<p>May did not speak again for a few minutes. She was
thinking of what she had often thought&mdash;how she had
been first interested in Webster&rsquo;s work in the case concerning
Kathleen Weir&rsquo;s diamonds. She was wondering
if he ever saw her now&mdash;the woman he knew to be
John Temple&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>And Webster, watching her delicate profile, almost
guessed what was passing in her mind. But he tried
to change the current of her thoughts. He pointed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
a white-sailed little vessel scudding before the wind; he
talked of the sea and of the sky, and May listened, and
for the time her troubles faded from her mind.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, Sister Margaret seemed uneasy,
and began to fidget with her silver watch, twice unhooking
it from her waistband. She looked at May, but
May did not notice her. At last she said, in a slightly
marked tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a quarter-past one o&rsquo;clock, Mrs. Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; answered May, dreamily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I am sure Mr. Webster must require some
refreshment after his journey,&rdquo; said Sister Margaret,
in a very pointed manner.</p>

<p>May now understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; she said, rising. &ldquo;Will you come and
have lunch with us now, Mr. Webster?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be very pleased, if you will allow me to do
so,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, in that case, I will just hurry home and see
that it is ready,&rdquo; said Sister Margaret, with alacrity.
She was a handy woman, and instantly made up her
mind to add considerably to the usual chops at their
midday meal, on her way through the town, in honor
of their guest. But she did not wish him to know this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will leave you in charge of Mr. Webster,&rdquo; she
went on, and in a moment later hurried away so quickly
that Webster looked after her with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Sister Margaret is not going to give herself
any trouble on my account,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>May smiled; almost the first smile he had seen on
her face since she had left Pembridge Terrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she must wish to improve our usual lunch
on your account,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;She is such a good,
kind woman,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and she has gone
through so much trouble, Mr. Webster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her face rather gives you that impression. But
she looks happy enough now&mdash;or at least content.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a great thing to feel content.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A great thing, indeed; to know no longer the restless
craving for something we can not obtain.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and do you think&mdash;&rdquo; began May, and then she
paused, hesitated, and slightly colored.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I think what?&rdquo; said Webster, and he turned
round his head and looked at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think we could ever feel happy again&mdash;after
a great blow, a great shock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we could feel happy, but not the same happiness.
A sort of sobered, perhaps, a wiser happiness,
no doubt, might come to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous to be too happy,&rdquo; said May, with
downcast eyes and quivering lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not many of us have the chance of being so,&rdquo;
answered Webster, rising. &ldquo;But, come, we must not
keep Sister Margaret waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and May also rose, and together they walked
down the pier, but Webster merely talked of the people
that they passed on their way. He wished her to forget,
for a time at least, the shadow on her young life;
the grief that had made it so hard to bear.</p>

<p>Sister Margaret had not exerted herself in vain. In
addition to the usual dish of chops, she had purchased
a pigeon pie, a lobster, and various trifles on her way
through the town. In fact, she looked on the repast
she spread before Webster with pardonable pride. And
he tried to make the whole thing pleasant. He told
some good stories; he complimented Sister Margaret
on her pie, and the good woman thoroughly enjoyed
herself. And when lunch was over, Webster, after
going to the window and looking at the smooth sea
and the sailing boats scudding on its blue breast, proposed
that they should go out for a sail, and Sister
Margaret was quite delighted with the idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been out for a sail since I was a girl,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;it will make me feel young again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; said Webster, looking at May, &ldquo;would
you like to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I should,&rdquo; answered May, gently.</p>

<p>So they went down to the beach and engaged a sailing
boat, and were soon flying on white wings before
the light gale. It was a beautiful day, sunny, cloudless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
almost warm, and yet with the crisp touch of the
early winter in the clear air. That crisp touch brought
a wild-rose bloom back once more to May&rsquo;s fair oval
cheeks; it brightened her eyes, and she smiled more
than once as she sat by Webster&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never been on the sea before,&rdquo; she said to
Webster. &ldquo;Do you remember when&mdash;&rdquo; and for a
moment she paused&mdash;&ldquo;when we rode on the Thames?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, Webster remembered that day too well; remembered
the beautiful girl sitting opposite to him in the
boat, on the reedy river, and dipping her white hands
in the stream. There was no shadow on her face then,
nor sorrow in her heart. Only sunshine and hope, with
the unknown future lying before her bathed in golden
light.</p>

<p>But he made no allusion to these memories.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like the sea better than the river,&rdquo; he said, and
there swept over his heart a strange and passionate
emotion as he spoke; a wish to bear May away from
her troubles forever; to carry her to a new haven of
rest and peace.</p>

<p>But by and by the short winter day began to close,
and Sister Margaret drew her cloak nearer to her
throat with a little shiver, and glanced uneasily at the
distant shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time we were returning, is it not, Mr. Webster?&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>These words roused Webster from his love-dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose it is,&rdquo; he said, and he gave directions
to the boatmen to set sail for the shore. But it was
nearly dark when they reached Hastings, and there
was a silver track from a half-moon on the rippling
tide.</p>

<p>They crossed this in the boat, and Webster hailed it
as a good omen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means a silver lining to our clouds,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a
sign that we must always hope.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />

<small>A SUDDEN CHANGE.</small></h2>


<p>May and Sister Margaret stayed another fortnight at
Hastings after this sea excursion, and Webster went
twice down to see them during this time, and Sister Margaret
was satisfied in her own mind that everything was
progressing as she could wish. Then the weather broke
up, and storms and gales swept around the coast, and
the sea-foam flew into the town. And it was only when
this happened that Webster yielded to May&rsquo;s repeated
requests for them to return to London. She wished
now most earnestly to commence working to earn her
own living, and had had some correspondence with
Doctor Brentwood on the subject. He had arranged
that she should join the staff of nurses at St. Phillip&rsquo;s,
as probationer, and Sister Margaret had already given
her some instructions. But twice during this time a
strong temptation rose in Ralph Webster&rsquo;s heart; a
temptation, however, which he checked, and this was to
ask May to be his wife, and so shelter her all her future
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would but frighten her, and make her uneasy,&rdquo;
he told himself; &ldquo;no, it is too soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So May went back to St. Phillip&rsquo;s with Sister Margaret,
and when Webster saw her again she was
dressed in the black gown and white cap and apron of
a nurse. She looked, however, so charming in this
costume that he could not conceal his admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look like&mdash;well, what shall I say?&rdquo; he said,
smiling. &ldquo;A sister of light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean an angel?&rdquo; answered May, smiling
also. &ldquo;Ah, I wish I felt like one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how do you really like the life?&rdquo; went on
Webster, with his dark eyes still fixed on her fair face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are painful things, of course,&rdquo; hesitated
May, &ldquo;but still you always feel that you are helping
someone, and that is something.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I hope they do not give you any hard work;
any disagreeable work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are very good to me,&rdquo; answered May, softly;
&ldquo;everyone has been very good, and as for you, Mr. Webster&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Being good is not in my way,&rdquo; answered Webster,
hastily turning away his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know what you call good then; I can not
tell you what I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May&rsquo;s voice faltered a little when she said this, and
Webster&rsquo;s self-imposed reserve perhaps might have
broken down, but just at this moment Doctor Brentwood
entered the room, as it was in his sitting-room
that the interview between May and Webster was taking
place. Indeed, it must be admitted that &ldquo;Mrs.
Church&rdquo; was treated with some favoritism by the
house surgeon; and there were some plain nurses and
some plain probationers who made their private comments
and remarks on this fact. But May was so
gentle and unassuming that as a rule she disarmed
criticism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her pretty face,&rdquo; they said, shrugging their
shoulders; &ldquo;well, men are all alike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And her pretty face had no doubt a great deal to do
with it, and her pretty manner, and her sad, sweet
smile. Doctor Brentwood openly said to Webster she
was too handsome for a nurse, but he knew, as all men
who looked at her knew, that she never sought or
desired attention or admiration of any kind.</p>

<p>And so the quiet, dreary months drifted away, and
May stayed on at St. Phillip&rsquo;s Hospital, and only
Ralph Webster knew that she lived there. Of John
Temple, Webster heard nothing, except that one day,
when Christmas was past and gone, he accidentally
met Mr. Harrison, the solicitor, who told him smilingly
that he had had a visit from the actress, Miss Kathleen
Weir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had heard somehow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Mr. John
Temple is now heir to his uncle&rsquo;s estates, and she
therefore wished her allowance increased. But I put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
her off, my dear sir, I put her off; quite time enough
when Mr. John Temple does succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where is Mr. John Temple now?&rdquo; asked Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is abroad; he went abroad shortly after I had
the visit from Miss Kathleen Weir, and he looks shockingly
ill; really shockingly. I wish, I am sure, he may
live to come into his inheritance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of man is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He used to be a remarkably nice fellow; pleasant,
and rather philosophical in fact. But when I saw him
last he had a most shattered appearance, like a man
who had gone through some great mental strain, or
bodily illness. I fancy, you know, Mr. Webster,&rdquo; added
the little man, shaking his head, &ldquo;that that early and
unfortunate marriage of his has been a most tremendous
worry to him. At least when I mentioned Miss
Weir having called at my offices he scowled, and muttered
something about wishing he had never seen her
face. He may, you see, now want to form a more reasonable
marriage, but there is this millstone&mdash;a handsome
enough millstone though, ha, ha, ha! hanging
about his neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He should not forget that he hung it himself though,&rdquo;
answered Webster, grimly; and then he left Mr. Harrison.
But when he next saw Kathleen Weir, in reply
to her eager inquiries, he was able to tell her that he
had heard that Mr. John Temple had gone abroad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where and when?&rdquo; asked the actress quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I can not tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Webster, I am anxious to know. That old
rogue, Mr. Harrison, the solicitor, of course knows
very well. But if I went to him he would not tell me.
How am I to find out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what good would it do you to find out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I am convinced John Temple has something
to hide! I want to be divorced from him, that&rsquo;s
the truth, and if I knew where he was I could set
detectives to watch his movements. Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately I can not tell you where he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if old Harrison would tell you? Oh! do
be a good soul and help me if you can,&rdquo; and she laid
her pretty, white, be-ringed hand on his arm and looked
into his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so stupid to be bound like this to a
man who is perfectly indifferent to you, and, moreover,
who actually detests you! I swear to you he looked as
if he really hated me that day on Westminster bridge.
And why should I waste all my youth and my life?
His money is not worth it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a very hard case, certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have felt this lately,&rdquo; said Kathleen Weir, in
rather a marked manner; &ldquo;before, I think I did not
care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again she looked in Webster&rsquo;s face, and with a sort
of discomfort his keen dark eyes fell before her large,
restless, gray ones. He was not a vain man, but a
vague consciousness smote into his heart that this
handsome woman had begun to regard him with different
feelings to his own. This idea made him more
chary of his visits and colder in his manner. And
Kathleen Weir, quick to perceive this, also drew back.
Thus some weeks passed without him seeing her, when
one morning an announcement in the <i>Times</i> brought
her affairs more prominently before his mind.</p>

<p>This was no less than a notice in the obituary
column of the sudden death of the squire of Woodlea:</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 21st inst., at Woodlea Hall, Phillip Temple,
Esq., aged 75, of heart disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster read the announcement twice over, thinking
all the while of the great changes it might bring.
Not to the fair black-robed probationer at St. Phillip&rsquo;s
Hospital, though, he decided; it could not touch her
very nearly now, but to John Temple and Kathleen
Weir.</p>

<p>And yet on second thoughts he remembered it would
bring Temple back to England, and would make the
friends of the missing girl more eager in their inquiries
to learn her fate. John Temple would probably now
be forced to tell what he knew, and the fact of his first
marriage might be brought home to him. Therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
the knowledge of the squire&rsquo;s death disquieted Webster
exceedingly, and the day did not pass without his
receiving further news concerning it.</p>

<p>The evening post in fact brought him a letter from
Kathleen Weir, and the notice from the <i>Times</i> of
Mr. Temple&rsquo;s death fell out of it when Webster opened
the envelope. The actress had evidently written in a
state of great excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Webster</span>,&rdquo; he read. &ldquo;The inclosed cutting
from the newspaper will tell you what has occurred.
This Mr. Temple, whose death it records, is the uncle
of John Temple, who is his heir. John Temple is now,
therefore, a rich man, and as I am unfortunately his
wife, he can not prevent (I suppose) my benefiting by
his accession to fortune. But though money is a great
thing, an immense thing, it is not everything! John
Temple, looking like a ghost, with misery stamped on
every feature of his face! There was, I am sure, some
strong reason for this, for as a rule he is an easy-going
man, inclined to make the best of everything, as he
used to think it not worth while to strive with fate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There I did and do disagree with him. It is worth
while at any rate to try and make the best of one&rsquo;s life,
and it is not making the best of mine, I think, to remain
the wife of a man I never see. He is a rich man now,
can afford to pay a long price for his freedom, and his
freedom I am certain he desires. What I mean is this:
He will now be coming to England, and will, of course,
go down to the place he has inherited. I want, therefore,
someone to go to him and make him a proposition;
to say in fact, Kathleen Weir, the wife of whom
you are tired, is also tired of you, and wishes to be free
from so galling a tie. I am certain it might be arranged,
only it is so difficult to write on such matters, and one
can only do so to someone in whom you have complete
confidence. I have complete confidence in you, though
I have seen so little of you of late, but I think I can
understand the reason of this. At all events, will you
come to see me now, and we can talk the matter over?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Will you come to-morrow evening? I shall be alone,
as I have a whole host of things to tell you.</p>

<p class="signoff">&ldquo;Ever sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="right">&rdquo;<span class="smcap">Kathleen Weir</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster read this letter, and at once understood its
meaning. Kathleen Weir wished to be free, and she
believed that John Temple had given her cause to seek
a divorce, and that if she were anxious to obtain one,
that he would offer no opposition; nay, gladly aid her
in her desire. She also meant, and Webster smiled a
little scornfully as he thought this, that she intended to
make him pay for his freedom. They were to play
into each other&rsquo;s hands in fact, and she wished some
confidential friend or agent to approach him on the
subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if she intends this honor for me,&rdquo; he
reflected, bitterly. And he thought of May Churchill
with a quick pang of pain.</p>

<p>If this woman could obtain a divorce, and would
accept money to be divorced, which no doubt John
Temple would gladly pay, he would be free to marry
May. Webster bit his lips and frowned angrily at this
idea. This no doubt was Kathleen Weir&rsquo;s design; she
would not scruple, she had said, to invent a charge of
cruelty against him, and for the rest she had a perfectly
good case.</p>

<p>Webster began walking restlessly up and down the
room after he had considered the actress&rsquo; letter, but he
determined to do nothing to aid her.</p>

<p>But if she succeeded, what should he do? What
would be best and kindest to the poor girl whose heart
John Temple had nearly broken?</p>

<p>It was a painful question, not easy to answer or to
solve, but at all events Kathleen Weir had not yet
obtained her divorce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go and see her,&rdquo; he decided; &ldquo;I will learn
exactly what she means to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Therefore on the following evening he did go to see
her, and she was very pleased to welcome him. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
started up as he entered the room, and held out her
little white hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How good of you to come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have been
wishing so much to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to talk over your great news,&rdquo; he answered
with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is great news, isn&rsquo;t it? Great and good news,
for I hope soon it will free me of John Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;what have you to go upon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will find something to go upon,&rdquo; said the actress,
half impatiently. &ldquo;I have his address, at all events,
now, for he is sure to go to Woodlea Hall and look
after his property, and I must find someone&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo;
and she paused and thought for a moment, and then
clapped her hands. &ldquo;I must find someone,&rdquo; she
repeated, &ldquo;to go to him, or go myself. There, Mr.
Webster, what do you think of that? What do you
think of my going to visit my lord in his new state?
I would be a welcome visitor, wouldn&rsquo;t I, and no doubt
could make a splendid bargain with him in his eagerness
to get rid of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;it would expose you to a very painful scene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am accustomed to scenes, you know,&rdquo; answered
Kathleen Weir, with a little laugh. &ldquo;Do you know I
think it is a splendid idea. At all events, we might
mutually agree to meet somewhere, and arrange also
mutually to get rid of each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what about the Queen&rsquo;s Proctor intervening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kathleen Weir gave an airy shrug of her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must manage to be too clever for the Queen&rsquo;s
Proctor, and John Temple, I&rsquo;m certain, will be only too
glad to back me up in anything I say. I shall have some
handfuls of hair ready, and swear he tore them out of
my head.&rdquo; And Kathleen Weir laughed.</p>

<p>But Ralph Webster did not laugh. He was thinking
of May Churchill, and how her fate might hang on the
false words of this woman&rsquo;s tongue, and he looked very
grave when he rose to go away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going so soon?&rdquo; cried Kathleen Weir, gaily. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
was disappointed at his leaving so early, but she did
not wish to show this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can wait,&rdquo; she thought, after he had quitted the
room; &ldquo;they say everything comes to those who wait.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />

<small>THE DEAD MAN&rsquo;S BELONGINGS.</small></h2>


<p>Mr. Temple&rsquo;s sudden death had also naturally created
great excitement both at Woodlea Hall and at the farm
at Woodside. The squire had breakfasted with his wife
as usual on the morning it occurred, and about an hour
later Mrs. Temple had gone into the library to ask him
for some money she required, when to her surprise and
alarm she found him with his gray head lying on the
writing-table before him, and his arms hanging limply
by his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phillip!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and ran up to him, and laid
her hands on his shoulder.</p>

<p>But the face that had ever looked gently at her did
not stir. Then Mrs. Temple raised his head, and the
moment she did so she gave a wild shriek. For there
was no mistaking the pallid gray hue of the complexion,
or the dull, glazed, half-open eyes. Mr. Temple was
dead, and Mrs. Temple, ever impulsive and excitable,
ran screaming to the door of the room to tell the news
and summon the household.</p>

<p>They sent for the doctor, and the newly-made
widow knelt by the squire&rsquo;s side and chafed his cold
hands, and wailed and wept for the man to whom in
his lifetime she had given no love. Now she regretted
this, she clung to him, and would fain have recalled
him to her side.</p>

<p>And presently her mother arrived on the scene and
then her father. Mrs. Layton&rsquo;s first thought when she
heard the squire was dead was to speculate on how
much he had left behind him, and to groan in spirit at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
the idea that now her daughter would probably have
to leave the Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that John Temple will be coming, I suppose,&rdquo;
she whispered to her husband, &ldquo;and where will we all
be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, to speak of such things in the presence of
death&mdash;&rdquo; began the vicar, mildly. But Mrs. Layton
turned her little eager face away from him before he
could complete his homily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must see after things,&rdquo; she said, which meant a
great deal to Mrs. Layton&rsquo;s mind. First she had to
induce her daughter to leave the dead man&rsquo;s side and
go to her own apartments. Then she ran from room to
room, picking up little things here and there that she
thought at such a time she could collect without remark.
Nothing came wrong to Mrs. Layton! A few sheets of
note-paper, an envelope or two, anything in fact that
she could lay her hands on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will never be missed; they are of no value,&rdquo;
she told herself as she gathered her spoil together.
She was haunted by the idea that John Temple might
arrive at any moment, and that she would not have
such another opportunity.</p>

<p>The servants were all down-stairs talking of their
master&rsquo;s sudden death, and the whole household
naturally disarranged. Mrs. Temple was in a state of
half-remorseful grief and excitement, and she also was
now thinking of the coming of John Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will be master now, I suppose,&rdquo; she thought
bitterly, &ldquo;and I shall be turned out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She remembered, too, the morning he had left
Woodlea through her interference, and mentally saw
again his pale, set face as he had told her he would
never return. He would return now, and would that
girl come with him? Mrs. Temple kept asking herself.
For up to the time of the squire&rsquo;s death nothing had
been seen or heard at the Hall of John Temple since
the morning he quitted it. Mr. Temple had felt
naturally offended by his nephew&rsquo;s reticence, but at
last, at Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s earnest request, he had written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
to John Temple&rsquo;s bankers to ask if they could tell him
of his nephew&rsquo;s whereabouts. The bankers wrote to
inform the squire, in reply, that Mr. John Temple was
abroad, and that before leaving England he had taken
out a considerable sum of money in letters of credit.
They wrote nothing more; they had, in fact, been
instructed by John Temple before he left England to
give no information if any inquiries were made about
him. He had gone away a moody and remorseful man,
but Mr. Harrison, the solicitor, knew where to find him,
and also some officers of the police force. With these
he had left orders, which he believed now to be useless,
that should anything ever be heard of the lady who
had disappeared from the Grosvenor Hotel on such a
date that he was at once to be communicated with.
But John Temple believed that May was dead; believed
that in a sudden frenzy of grief and shame she had
destroyed herself. And many a dark and dismal hour
he had stood looking down into the murky river,
moodily thinking it was sweeping over the fair head of
his young love. It was on one of these miserable
occasions that Kathleen Weir had seen him, and a
sudden feeling of hate and anger had swept through
his heart at the sight of her. And shortly after this
encounter he had left England. He felt, in truth, that
he could bear the strain no farther; that the terrible
haunting memory of the young life he believed he had
destroyed would overthrow his reason if he remained
any longer on the spot.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Mr. Churchill, in spite of his own
secret anxieties, had gone about telling his neighbors
that his daughter and her husband, Mr. John Temple,
were abroad. There was no one to contradict this, yet
somehow the impression got about that everything was
not quite right. Perhaps it was the way in which Mrs.
Churchill drew in her firm lips when her husband spoke
of his daughter. At all events, she never spoke of her,
nor did she encourage her stepsons to do so.</p>

<p>At first the boys had been overjoyed when they
heard of May&rsquo;s marriage, and looked forward to many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
a happy day at the Hall. But when week after week
passed, and May never wrote to them, they could not
understand it.</p>

<p>What was to prevent her writing? they asked each
other, doubtfully, even if she were twenty times abroad.
Then the banker&rsquo;s letter confirmed the news that John
Temple was abroad, and after that, all through the
winter months, neither at the Hall nor at the homestead,
was anything more heard of John Temple or May.</p>

<p>The squire died in the early spring-time, and the
news reached Woodside in less than an hour after Mrs.
Temple had found her husband dead. It naturally
threw Mr. Churchill, and even his wife, into a state of
excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, we must hear from them!&rdquo; cried Mr.
Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will know the truth at last,&rdquo; said Mrs. Churchill,
in a more subdued tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What truth?&rdquo; answered her husband, sharply.
&ldquo;They were married, and now Mr. John Temple is the
squire of Woodlea, and May is his wife&mdash;but all the
same, I am sorry to hear the old squire has passed
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will they let Mr. John Temple know that his
uncle is dead, if they do not know where he is?&rdquo; suggested
Mrs. Churchill in her practical way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see to that,&rdquo; replied Mr. Churchill, determinedly.
&ldquo;There will be no one, I suppose, to look
after things at the Hall now but the stupid old parson
and his skin-flint of a wife. Madam won&rsquo;t know anything
about business, so as May&rsquo;s father I will ride over
at once, and of course Mr. Temple, as heir, must be
immediately telegraphed for. His bankers, by this
time, probably really do know where he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are quite right to go, William,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Churchill, who, in truth, was full of curiosity to
know all about the matter.</p>

<p>So Mr. Churchill mounted his horse and speedily
reached the Hall in a state of scarcely suppressed
excitement. And his coming was not unnoticed. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
Layton, from one of the upper windows, peered down
into the court-yard when she heard the sound of his
horse&rsquo;s hoofs below, and gave a kind of cry when she
saw who it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is the first of them!&rdquo; she exclaimed aloud to
herself, and then she hastily looked round the room to
see what she could pick up before &ldquo;the others arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She caught up some trifle, and then hurried down to
her daughter&rsquo;s bedroom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rachel!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that Churchill has arrived;
you must rouse yourself, and lock up all the jewels and
silver, or they will be laying hands on everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple,
coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, you&rsquo;ll let them have the diamonds!&rdquo; screamed
Mrs. Layton, in absolute despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The diamonds are heirlooms, so I suppose John
Temple&rsquo;s wife&mdash;if he has one&mdash;has a right to wear
them,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple, contemptuously. &ldquo;I
will have nothing touched until John Temple arrives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll lose everything! Do you suppose that
low people like these Churchills will not seize whatever
they can get? At all events, secure the jewels and the
money in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go away and leave me alone!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Temple, passionately. &ldquo;Surely on a day like this&mdash;&rdquo;
And then she suddenly burst into tears. Even to her
wayward mind, this greed was shocking in the house of
death.</p>

<p>Her mother left her with uplifted hands after this
outburst. But Mrs. Layton was still determined not to
waste her time. She therefore hurried into the poor
squire&rsquo;s dressing-room and snatched up and secured on
her person his diamond studs, which were lying in a
tray on the toilet table. Then she looked eagerly
around for his keys. He was sure to have money
locked away somewhere, she was thinking. But she
could not find the keys, and after a vain search for
them she opened a linen drawer and turned out half a
dozen or so of pocket handkerchiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor man, he will never want them more,&rdquo; she
reflected; &ldquo;and I have such bad colds every winter
they&rsquo;ll come in nice and handy, and the servants were
sure to have stolen them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having pocketed these also, she went down-stairs to
see Mr. Churchill. She found him closeted with her
husband, the vicar. The two men were discussing the
best plan how immediately to inform John Temple of
his uncle&rsquo;s death. Mr. Churchill had told the vicar of
the banker&rsquo;s letter, and had suggested this as a means
of communication with the new heir.</p>

<p>The letter would probably be in the drawers of the
writing-table in the library, Mr. Churchill had said, but
the vicar&mdash;a timid man&mdash;had shrunk a little back from
approaching a spot where so lately had lain the poor
squire&rsquo;s gray head. Mr. Churchill, however, urged that
it should be done, and they were talking it over when
Mrs. Layton entered the room.</p>

<p>She extended her thin, claw-like hand to Mr. Churchill,
but coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a sad affair, madam,&rdquo; said Mr. Churchill as he
took it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not for everyone,&rdquo; she could not help replying, spitefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think for everyone,&rdquo; answered the farmer, sturdily;
&ldquo;we all have to go, but the squire was a good man, and
a good friend to all who knew him. There was but one
opinion about the squire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But one, I am sure,&rdquo; said the vicar, weakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been talking to the vicar, madam,&rdquo; went on
Mr. Churchill, still sturdily, &ldquo;about the best and quickest
way of communicating with Mr. John Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have not his address, I understood,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Layton, quickly and viciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be soon found, madam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought not,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Layton, yet more
viciously. &ldquo;I understand that since Mr. John Temple
quitted this house in such an extraordinary manner,
that neither he nor&mdash;your daughter have ever been
heard of.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s clear, brown face turned a dusky red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken then,&rdquo; he said, sharply. &ldquo;I saw
and heard of them both. I saw the register of their
marriage and the clergyman who married them and the
two ladies who were present at the ceremony! But I
won&rsquo;t discuss it. Vicar, will you go with me to seek
the banker&rsquo;s letter in the squire&rsquo;s writing-table, or shall
I go alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you must go, James?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Layton. &ldquo;There may be family affairs in the writing-table
not intended for Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s inspection. But
I think this haste is most indecent; the poor man not
cold yet, and everyone in such a hurry to get what is
left! But we could expect nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this parting shot Mrs. Layton quitted the room,
and half an hour later the letter from John Temple&rsquo;s
banker informing the squire that his nephew was abroad,
was found by Mr. Churchill and the vicar in one of the
drawers of the writing-table in the library. By this
time the dead man had been borne away, yet there
were traces of his familiar presence all around. The
pen he had been using when his summons came; an
unfinished letter lying on the blotting pad; the keys
Mrs. Layton had coveted; the chair on which he had
died!</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Churchill sat down there, and deemed he was
doing his duty as he did so, and deliberately wrote to
John Temple, his successor. He also wrote to the bankers,
requesting them to forward the inclosed letter to
Mr. John Temple at once when they received it, if they
knew his address, and, at the same time, suggested that
a telegram might be sent immediately. Then, having
done this, he looked around a little sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor man,&rdquo; he said to the vicar, &ldquo;everything reminds
one of him&mdash;ah, well, it&rsquo;s very sad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his heart was not sad as he rode home. He felt
almost as though he himself had come into some portion
of the dead man&rsquo;s inheritance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br />

<small>JOHN TEMPLE&rsquo;S RETURN.</small></h2>


<p>When a rich man dies the news soon spreads. Mr.
Churchill had not neglected when he wrote to John
Temple and the bankers, also to send an announcement
of the squire&rsquo;s death to the <i>Times</i>. This announcement
was read on the following morning, as we have seen, by
Ralph Webster, by Kathleen Weir, and also by Mr.
Harrison, the solicitor, as well as the bankers.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Harrison and the bankers knew at this time
where to find the heir. John Temple, after various
restless wanderings, had gone to Cairo, and had written
from there to his bankers, and also to Mr. Harrison, on
business. Mr. Harrison read the news of Mr. Temple&rsquo;s
death, and at once telegraphed the information to his
now rich client. And during the day the firm of bankers
also telegraphed, and forwarded Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s
letter.</p>

<p>These two telegrams were a great shock to the lonely
and unhappy man to whom they were addressed. John
Temple had gone to Egypt to try and divert his mind,
and the change had no doubt been good for him; but
to learn that his uncle was dead, that Woodlea was now
his, seemed to bring all the past back to him with fresh
pain.</p>

<p>At first he determined not to return to England; not
to accept the fortune and position which were now his.
Then came Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s letter&mdash;a distinct, explicit
letter&mdash;and he knew as he read it that it was useless
any longer to hide the truth. Mr. Churchill would
insist on learning his daughter&rsquo;s fate; would no doubt,
now that he knew his address, find him out and force it
from his lips.</p>

<p>With an intense feeling of shrinking pain John Temple
therefore accepted the position thrust upon him.
He telegraphed to Mrs. Temple at Woodlea that he
would arrive there, he expected, on such a date, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
telegraphed also to Mr. Harrison. He did not, however,
write to Mr. Churchill; he felt this was beyond his
strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell him the truth,&rdquo; he told himself, and tried
to nerve himself for the bitter task. &ldquo;They may do
what they like,&rdquo; he thought, gloomily; &ldquo;I can not, I
think, suffer more than I have already done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple was greatly excited when she received
this telegram. Her husband already lay in his grave,
and had been followed there by his friends and tenantry.
His young widow, however, did not go. She
watched the long procession leave the Hall with dry
eyes. She had got accustomed to the idea and was
not even thinking of the dead when they bore him
away.</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill was one of the mourners, and he could
not help having a certain uneasy feeling in his mind as
he listened to the solemn words of the service, while
the old squire was laid by his young son&rsquo;s side. He had
heard from the bankers, who had informed him that
Mr. John Temple was at Cairo, and that they had forwarded
his letters to him there. But no word had
come from John Temple in reply. Mr. Churchill, therefore,
could not understand it. But surely soon the
mystery would end; in fact it must end, Mr. Churchill
determined, when he turned away from the squire&rsquo;s
grave.</p>

<p>And a day later brought John Temple&rsquo;s telegram to
Mrs. Temple. Her mother, who had not left the Hall
since the squire&rsquo;s death, carried it to her, and Mrs.
Temple tore it open with trembling hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is coming home!&rdquo; she cried, and that was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Temple?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Layton, aghast, who
had secretly begun to hope that something might have
happened to the new owner of Woodlea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple, without looking up.</p>

<p>She was re-reading John Temple&rsquo;s telegram, which
was couched in his usual somewhat graceful language.
In it he expressed his deep regret for &ldquo;your, may I say
our, great loss.&rdquo; Then came the day and date that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
expected to arrive in England, and on the following
day, after he had done so, he proposed to go to Woodlea,
&ldquo;if quite convenient to yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple smiled a little scornfully as she read the
last words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has the whip hand now,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;he said
I turned him out of the house, and now he can turn
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple, in fact, knew this to be the case. The
squire&rsquo;s will had been read, and though she was most
amply provided for, the Hall and its contents went to
the heir. This arrangement was only in accordance
with the original entailment of the property. Mrs. Layton,
as we know, had tried hard to have this clause set
aside, but the squire would listen to no such suggestion.
The Hall went with the estate, and John Temple was
now its owner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;does he mention anything about bringing
anyone home with him?&rdquo; now inquired Mrs. Layton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word; I don&rsquo;t believe that girl is his wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet Mr. Churchill assured your father and myself
that she is. And your father knows by name the
clergyman who he says married them, Mr. Mold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we shall see, at all events; he will soon be
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple, however, sent no message to Mr.
Churchill that John was expected shortly at Woodlea.
She desired her mother not to mention it; she wished
to be the first, at all events, to know the truth about
John Temple&rsquo;s marriage.</p>

<p>And until the day of his arrival she was very restless.
A second telegram came on the morning of that day
to tell her he expected to be at Woodlea by about seven
o&rsquo;clock in the evening. A carriage was, therefore, sent
to the station to meet him, and Mrs. Temple wandered
about the house after this in a state of great excitement.
At last she heard the sound of the carriage wheels
returning, and, looking very pale and handsome, she
went into the hall to meet the new owner.</p>

<p>But when John Temple entered the house, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
lights fell on his altered face, she gave a little start and
a sort of cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; she said, as she went forward
and took his hand. &ldquo;Have you been ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple scarcely answered her. He looked
brown, lined, and haggard, and naturally returning to
Woodlea was very painful to him. Yet he bore himself
with a certain calmness and dignity. He nodded to
some of the servants that he knew, and then, on Mrs.
Temple beckoning him to do so, he followed her into
the morning room, and she hastily closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, after she had done this, looking
quickly up in his face; &ldquo;are you alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered John Temple, and his eyes fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she then?&rdquo; went on Mrs. Temple, excitedly.
&ldquo;The girl you took away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple&rsquo;s pale face grew a little paler, and his
lips quivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would to God I could tell you,&rdquo; he said, in a hoarse
and broken voice; &ldquo;but I know nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Know nothing!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Temple in the greatest
surprise. &ldquo;What do you mean by this, John Temple?
You can not expect us to believe you; her father, I am
certain, will not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have returned here to tell what I know,&rdquo; continued
Temple, still in that broken voice; &ldquo;and I would give
all I possess in the world to be able to tell more. But I
can not&mdash;she&mdash;she left me one night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left you?&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Temple, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the night I left Woodlea. I went up to town;
I saw her, and I was forced to tell her what I feared
would break her heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you tell her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told her that the man she had trusted&mdash;the man
that she had loved, and believed to be her husband&mdash;for
we were married&mdash;had yet deceived her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? How did you deceive her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because when I was a very young man, almost a
lad, I had hung a millstone about my neck; I had married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
another woman, an actress, and I knew that this
now must come to May&rsquo;s ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Temple!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Temple, starting
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well look startled, yet this was so. I had
induced this poor girl to leave her home; to go to
some old friends of mine, and from their house we were
married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you said you were going abroad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did go abroad immediately after our marriage.
I intended it to be a secret marriage until the time
came I hoped to be able to obtain a divorce from the
woman I had first married. Until I met May I had not
cared nor thought of this. I made her an allowance, and
never made any inquiries about her life. But the nephew
of the ladies with whom I had left May got to know this
woman, this actress, Kathleen Weir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kathleen Weir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Kathleen Weir; and I knew after you had discovered
through young Henderson where May was
that the whole story could no longer be kept a secret.
But I believed she cared for me too well to part from
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Temple&rsquo;s voice broke and faltered, and he
paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she did part from you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Temple,
quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; went on John Temple, speaking
with a great effort. &ldquo;I took her to an hotel, and I told
her the truth, and after the first shock, which nearly
killed her, was over, I thought she had become reconciled
to the idea. I said we should never part; that I
would take her to Australia, anywhere, and devote my
whole life to her, and that I hoped some day to be free.
I left her for a short time to get some things that she
required before we went away, as she did not wish to
see her father, and&mdash;and when I left her she said we
could not live apart. I was not away more than an
hour, but when I returned to the hotel she was gone.
She had left no note, no address&mdash;not a word&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
from that day to this I have heard nothing,&rdquo; and Temple
covered his face with his hand, deeply affected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you sought her, surely? You made inquiries?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every effort was made to find her. I employed the
police, I wandered about the streets of London day and
night, but it was all in vain. One thing only I heard&mdash;that
someone like her, on the night she disappeared
from the hotel, had taken a cab and asked to be driven
to Westminster bridge&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely you did not think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could I think?&rdquo; went on John Temple, with
deep emotion. &ldquo;I believed she had loved me too well
to leave me, and&mdash;and perhaps in her misery&mdash;her
despair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my poor fellow, I am sorry for you!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Temple, and she went up to John Temple and laid
her hand on his arm. &ldquo;So this is the story, is it? A
sad, sad story!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left England, meaning never to return,&rdquo; continued
Temple, after a short pause. &ldquo;Even when the news
came of my poor uncle&rsquo;s death I did not mean to do so.
I received a letter from Mr. Churchill; a letter he had
a right to write, and to which I was bound in honor to
reply. I have come back for the purpose of doing this;
I will tell him the truth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not talk of it any more just now,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs.
Temple. &ldquo;This is your own house now, but let me,
for once at least, act as hostess. You will find your old
rooms all ready for you, and we dine at half-past eight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I am too tired to dine; will you excuse
me?&rdquo; said Temple, wearily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense, I won&rsquo;t excuse you. We shall
be quite alone. My good mother has been with me
since your poor uncle&rsquo;s death until to-day; but to-day I
insisted on her departure. I was not going to have you
annoyed by her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for being so considerate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you know I always wished to be good friends
with you; it was not until&mdash;well, never mind, let us forget
the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear that is impossible,&rdquo; said John Temple, sadly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events do not let us talk of it. Good-by for
the present then; I will see you in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this she left him, and John Temple went slowly
upstairs to his old rooms. These were all lighted and
ready for him, with bright fires burning in the grates,
and obsequious servants eager to attend on their new
master. But John Temple felt unutterably depressed.
Everything reminded him of the lovely face he believed
now was befouled and stained by the river&rsquo;s slime, and
when he was alone he covered his face and moaned
aloud.</p>

<p>But presently the dinner-gong sounded, and he was
forced to go down-stairs and act his part. To do Mrs.
Temple justice, she tried in every way to divert his
mind. She made him tell her about Egypt, and spoke
to him about books and travels, and talked to him as
best she could. She felt, in truth, sorry for the gloomy-faced
man opposite to her, and in her impulsive way
she showed this very plainly.</p>

<p>And when the dinner was over, and the servants had
left the room, John Temple asked her the particulars
of his uncle&rsquo;s death. She told him how sudden it had
been, and that she had gone into the library and found
him dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a great shock to me,&rdquo; she said, and for a
moment her lips quivered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a terrible shock to me also,&rdquo; he answered;
&ldquo;he was a good man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was very fond of you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple, turning
away her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not ungrateful,&rdquo; replied John Temple, in a
low tone, and his gray eyes fell; &ldquo;though I fear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know this house is yours, and everything
in it?&rdquo; went on Mrs. Temple, the next moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not live here, and if you wish to do so I hope
you will remain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can settle all that afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that Henderson, what became of him?&rdquo; now
asked John Temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, after that blow he got, you know, he was very
ill. He had brain fever, or something like it, and when
he got a little better his mother took him away. They
have not been at home all the winter, and Stourton
Grange is shut up. Some people say Henderson is in a
lunatic asylum, but it may not be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He drank, did he not?&rdquo; said Temple, coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they said. I can not tell, but I think he never
got over the death of that girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But a moment later Mrs. Temple wished her words
unsaid. John Temple rose restlessly and began walking
slowly up and down the room, and a few minutes
later asked leave to retire. It was more painful even
than he had expected, coming back to Woodlea, and he
felt that it would be impossible for him to remain. In
the meanwhile the news of his arrival had reached
Woodside Farm. One of Mr. Churchill&rsquo;s neighbors had
called during the evening, and told Mr. Churchill, not
without motives of curiosity, that he had seen &ldquo;the new
squire at the station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! are you sure?&rdquo; asked Mr. Churchill, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; answered the neighbor; &ldquo;I went to the
station about getting the turnip seed, and saw one of
the Hall carriages standing there. I know the coachman,
and I asked if anyone was expected, and he said
Mr. John Temple, the new Squire, was coming home
from foreign parts, and he was waiting for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Mr. Churchill, with faltering tongue,
and his bronzed face grew a little pale, &ldquo;did you see
him arrive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought I might just as well hang about till
the train came in; I was waiting for the seed, you see;
and when the train did come, Mr. John Temple came
with it, and he got into the carriage from the Hall and
drove away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And was he alone?&rdquo; asked Mr. Churchill, with
scarcely suppressed agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite alone; he had no servant or nothing.
The porter carried his portmanteau to the carriage; I
am quite certain he had no one with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Churchill asked no more questions. He also now
understood the motive of his neighbor&rsquo;s call, but he was
not a man to gratify idle curiosity. He drew in his firm
lips; he made up his mind at once to see John Temple.</p>

<p>He did not even tell his wife the news he had just
heard. Mrs. Churchill had more than once annoyed
him by the way she had spoken, or rather insinuated,
her doubts concerning May&rsquo;s marriage. So he was
determined to say nothing more about it until he knew
the true cause of May&rsquo;s long silence and absence.</p>

<p>It was too late to go to the Hall that night, but as
early as ten o&rsquo;clock next morning he mounted his horse
and rode to Woodlea. John Temple had prepared his
mind for this visit; had told himself that if Mr. Churchill
did not call on him, that he himself would go to Woodside,
and tell the truth as far as he knew it. Yet, while
he and Mrs. Temple were still sitting at the breakfast
table, when a servant entered the room and announced
that Mr. Churchill had arrived and was waiting to see
him, John Temple was conscious that his heart sank
within him. But the next moment, with an effort, he
nerved himself for the meeting, and rose quietly from
the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask Mr. Churchill to go into the library,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The servant bowed and disappeared, and as he did so
Mrs. Temple started up excitedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How horrible for that man to come,&rdquo; she half-whispered.
&ldquo;Whatever will you say to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can I say but the truth?&rdquo; answered Temple,
gloomily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely you will not,&rdquo; and she went nearer to
him and laid her hand on his arm, and raised her dark
eyes to his face; &ldquo;you will not tell him&mdash;of your other
marriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; said Temple, hoarsely; &ldquo;how otherwise
could I account for&mdash;what he must know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But consider&mdash;he may be violent&mdash;a hundred
things may happen. John, I would not tell him that&mdash;say
that you quarreled, and that she left you&mdash;anything
but that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>John Temple hesitated, and Mrs. Temple saw this in
an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my advice, at least about this,&rdquo; she went on
eagerly. &ldquo;Telling him could do no good, and might
bring much harm. Just say you quarreled&mdash;say about
another woman, if you like&mdash;and that then she left
you, and that you have never seen or heard of her
since. I do not think as you do about it; she probably
did only leave you, and some day you may hear
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, John Temple; you can not tell what this man
might do if he knew the whole story. Leave it to time
at least, and say nothing rash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I meant to tell him everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I repeat it will do no good; it would only make
a violent scene, and no end of trouble might come of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still John Temple hesitated, while again and again
Mrs. Temple urged him not to tell Mr. Churchill more
than he could possibly help. And at last her arguments,
coupled with the natural shrinking of his own
heart, prevailed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the present then I will say we quarreled, and
that she left me,&rdquo; he said in a faltering voice. &ldquo;To tell
him more would do no good&mdash;and yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is right; tell him you quarreled about some
woman, and tell him how you have sought for her; how
you could hear nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple had no answer to this, and then slowly,
with a bowed head, he left the room and went toward
the library to face the man whose daughter he had
wronged.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.<br />

<small>A WOMAN&rsquo;S BARGAIN.</small></h2>


<p>As John Temple entered the library, Mr. Churchill,
who was standing by the fireplace, looked quickly up
in his face, and then crossed the room to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Temple,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I heard you had
arrived last night, so I rode over early this morning to
ask if May is with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had fixed to say this during his ride to the Hall,
and he blurted it out in the forced way that prepared
speeches are often made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unhappily she is not,&rdquo; answered John Temple, in a
low voice, and with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not with you! That&rsquo;s odd; then where did you
leave her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Temple did not speak; a quiver
passed over his face, and his lips trembled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Churchill,&rdquo; he began, and then he paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Temple, what is this mystery about?&rdquo;
now asked Mr. Churchill, sharply. &ldquo;I know you are
married to her, so what is wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We quarreled and she has left me,&rdquo; said Temple,
forcing himself to utter the words. &ldquo;She left me without
a line, or word&mdash;I can not tell you where she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can not tell me where she is! Quarreled with you
and left you!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Churchill in the utmost
astonishment. &ldquo;Mr. Temple, I can not believe such an
incredible story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet it is most unhappily true, Mr. Churchill. I
would give everything I possess in the world to be able
to tell you more&mdash;to tell you where she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Temple&rsquo;s voice broke and faltered as he uttered the
last words, and Mr. Churchill looked at him in absolute
amazement and consternation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; he said, in a hard,
angry voice, &ldquo;that this girl, who was so fond of you
that she left her home for you, has forsaken you after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
a few months of marriage? I can not, I will not believe
it; you are keeping something back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An incident came to May&rsquo;s ears&mdash;an incident of
my early life,&rdquo; faltered Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About some woman, I suppose?&rdquo; interrupted Mr.
Churchill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately about a woman, and&mdash;and after that
we quarreled, and she left me. She did not tell me she
was going; she gave me no hint, or I should never have
left her alone. But one night when I returned to our
hotel I found she was gone, and though I sought her
everywhere, though I put it into the hands of the
police, no trace of her, no reliable trace at least, has ever
been heard of her, and sometimes&mdash;I fear the worst.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Temple broke down; he covered his face with
his hand; his agitation was unmistakable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that my girl has put an end to herself,
though you may have given her great cause for quarreling
with you and leaving you? Then I don&rsquo;t believe it,
sir, I tell you that.&rdquo; And Mr. Churchill struck his
hand heavily down on the writing-table as he spoke.
&ldquo;She may have left you, I suppose she has, but she
had too much spirit, my May had, to take her life for
any such folly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only hope this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may not only hope it, but be sure of it! But
this must be investigated at once. I&rsquo;ll move heaven
and earth to find my girl; ay, and I&rsquo;ll find her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would to God that you could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will; there, I&rsquo;ve said it, and I seldom say what I
do not do. When and how did she disappear? Who
saw her last? Tell me everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then John Temple, in broken and faltering words,
did tell Mr. Churchill everything he knew of May&rsquo;s
disappearance. Only he kept back the true cause. He
gave him the address of the inspector of the police who
had conducted the inquiry; he told even the cabman&rsquo;s
story of the lady he had driven to Westminster bridge.
But Mr. Churchill would not listen to any such suggestion
that May had taken her young life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You may have broken her heart, perhaps you have,&rdquo;
he said, harshly, &ldquo;but my lass was no weak fool to
destroy herself for a worthless man! No, she is hiding
herself somewhere, and her father will find her. But
it&rsquo;s a pity, Mr. Temple,&rdquo; he added, bitterly, &ldquo;that you
did not leave her alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I loved her very dearly. Since she left me my life
has been one unending regret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you let another woman come between you!
This may be the way of fine gentlemen, but my poor
girl, I suppose, would not stand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Temple did not speak; he stood there facing the
angry man before him; his heart was full of shame and
pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The long and the short of it is, I suppose,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Churchill, &ldquo;that May believed that you had
ceased to love her; or had never loved her as she
thought you had, and so she left you. But she should
have written to her father! If I had not positively
ascertained that you were married to her, if I had not
seen the register of your marriage with my own eyes, I
would have found you both out long before this. However,
as it is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to whatever expense you like, Mr. Churchill;
find May, and you will lift a weight off my heart that is
almost too heavy to bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple spoke earnestly, almost passionately,
and Mr. Churchill could not but believe him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer business,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if you were fond
of her why did you not stick to her? But I&rsquo;ll start
to-night for London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me hear from you every day; I will join you if
you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m best alone; I&rsquo;m more likely to find her
alone. But what am I to go back and say at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say anything; what matter is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is matter to me, Mr. Temple! I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;ve
had a difference, and I&rsquo;m going to London to try to
make it up&mdash;yes, that will do, and I must make it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill left the Hall shortly after this, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
John Temple returned to the morning-room, where
Mrs. Temple was eagerly awaiting him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, excitedly, &ldquo;is he gone? What did
you tell him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you bade me; I told him everything&mdash;except
why she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left you? That was right. Oh! I&rsquo;m so glad, so
glad, John Temple, you did not tell him that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will probably come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may and it may not. At all events you may not
be here if it does; it is a thousand times best kept
quiet. And what is Mr. Churchill going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is going to London&mdash;going, I fear, on a vain
search.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may not be also. Come, we must hope for the
best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But John Temple only sadly shook his head. It
remained his fixed idea that May was dead, as he
believed she had loved him too well to live apart from
him.</p>

<p>But he felt grateful to Mrs. Temple for her kindness
and consideration for his feelings; grateful perhaps
that she had spared him telling May&rsquo;s father all the
bitter truth. And Mrs. Temple told the same story to
her mother. Mrs. Layton, we may be sure, was not
long in arriving at the Hall, but her daughter would
not allow her to see John Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You worry him, and he and his wife have quarreled
about some old love of his or other, and she has actually
left him,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Left him!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Layton, triumphantly. &ldquo;I
knew no good would come of it; no good ever does
come of unequal marriages. But I don&rsquo;t believe she
has left him; I believe he has left her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events they have parted,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and
naturally he does not wish to be asked any questions
on the subject, so while he is here please do not come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Layton drew her meager little form up to its
full height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Rachel, is it possible,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you forbid
your mother to the house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is John Temple&rsquo;s house now, not mine, and he
does not wish to be worried; so please stay away,&rdquo;
replied Mrs. Temple, coolly; and Mrs. Layton departed,
feeling that &ldquo;a judgment&rdquo; was sure to descend on her
daughter&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple told John Temple of this quarrel, and
laughed a little scornfully at the recollection of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother is a woman,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;on whom all
delicacy of feeling is wasted, for she has none;&rdquo; and
John Temple certainly agreed with her.</p>

<p>But on the third day after his arrival at Woodlea
something occurred which worried and disturbed him
more than twenty visits from Mrs. Layton. It was a
fine spring day and Mrs. Temple had gone out for a
drive, but John Temple had refused to accompany
her. However, about four o&rsquo;clock, tempted by the
sunshine, he lit a cigar and strolled out into the
park.</p>

<p>He walked on moodily enough with bent head, when
his attention was attracted by the sound of carriage
wheels approaching down the avenue. He supposed it
would be Mrs. Temple returning from her drive, and
so he walked on. But when the carriage drew nearer
and he was about to meet it, he saw it was not one of
the Hall carriages, but evidently a hired one. He therefore
turned hastily into a side path, for he was in no
mood to encounter strangers. Then he heard the carriage
stop, and a few moments later, when he again
looked around, he perceived a lady on the side path,
who was evidently following him.</p>

<p>He stopped, and for an instant the thought, the wild
hope, crossed his brain, could it be May? But no; the
lady who was approaching him, though closely veiled,
was taller than the slender girlish form of his lost love.
She advanced quickly, and in another minute they met;
and John Temple started back as they did so.</p>

<p>For it was the woman to whom he had not spoken
for long years; the woman he had wedded in his early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
youth, and whose existence had been a curse and a
stumbling-block in his way!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he said, sternly. &ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From a natural feeling of curiosity,&rdquo; answered the
actress, who bore the professional name of Kathleen
Weir. &ldquo;I wished to see you in your new home!&rdquo; And
she gave a little laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is useless&mdash;&rdquo; began John Temple; but with a
little airy wave of her hand she interrupted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it may be very useful to us
both. I have come with a purpose; a purpose which
I am quite sure will be a welcome one to you; I want
you to help me to get rid of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again she laughed, and then flung back her veil and
stood looking steadily at the husband who had forsaken
her. She was a handsome woman, but John Temple
saw no beauty in the large, bright, restless gray eyes;
in the mocking, saucy lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; he answered, coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet; but you will by and by. So this is your
new inheritance?&rdquo; she continued, looking round at the
wooded park, with the fine gray old mansion standing
in its midst. &ldquo;My friend John, I had no idea I had
made such a good match,&rdquo; she added, mockingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have come to talk thus, our interview must
end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! grudge me a word or two, after these long
years? Well, come, that is mean of you. But I have
not come to talk nonsense, but sense. I have come, in
fact, to talk business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you want your allowance increased?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kathleen Weir nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I certainly do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and my terms have
gone up since I have seen what a fine place you have
got. But it is not only about my allowance I want to
talk; I want to know if we can not arrange a divorce
between us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple looked at her quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My bait takes, I see,&rdquo; went on Kathleen Weir,
coolly. &ldquo;Now, you can&rsquo;t get a divorce from me; I&rsquo;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
been too careful for that; perhaps too cold, for a burnt
child dreads the fire; or maybe I was too prudent to
run the risk of losing my allowance. No, you can not
get a divorce from me; now, the question is, can I get
one from you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple was silent; he looked down, he moved
his hands impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the wonderful justice which the male law-givers
deal out to women, I am perfectly aware that you could
run away with anyone; with a dozen if you had a mind
to, and I could get no redress unless you had committed
some act, or acts, of cruelty, to which I could
swear. Now, to be free, I am ready to swear falsely; I
am ready to swear that you tore handfuls of hair out of
my head, and I have a false tress or two out of which
you can tear them&mdash;if you will make it worth my
while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend John, you are a rich man now, and I&rsquo;ve
no doubt will be ready to pay handsomely for your
liberty. You wish, I suppose, to be free of me, and be
able to marry someone else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some months ago,&rdquo; answered John Temple, with
quick emotion, &ldquo;I would have given anything to have
been so&mdash;now it is too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is it too late?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is useless to tell you; to tell you how our miserable
marriage spoilt a young life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But is it spoilt? And even if it is, I think you
should show a little consideration for me. I am tired
of leading the life I lead; I want someone to care a
little for me. I wish, in fact, to be divorced from you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to marry again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you will have it so, I think I do. But then,
you know, you must consider my position. You talk
of a spoilt life, but you spoilt and wasted my youth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is easy to put it so,&rdquo; said John Temple, bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you married me and left me, did you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We agreed to part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, after you had made my life so unpleasant that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
there was no standing it. But I don&rsquo;t want to fight, or
say disagreeable things. I really want to come to an
arrangement with you, an arrangement by which you
will benefit by being free; and I shall benefit by being
free also&mdash;only you must remember you are a rich
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple was silent for a moment or two; he was
turning it over in his mind whether to accept her
proposition; then he remembered he had not told Mr.
Churchill of his marriage to Kathleen Weir, that he
could not be divorced without this being publicly
known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll be quite frank with you,&rdquo; she went on,
looking at his moody face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll want either a lump
sum down, or a largely increased allowance for swearing
falsely and exhibiting in court the three handsful
of beautiful hair that you tore out of my unfortunate
head. You must pay, you see, for these little freaks
of temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your jesting is out of place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, my friend; life has always its comical
side. For instance, it is comical my coming here to
make a sensible bargain with you, instead of talking of
my broken heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume it is not broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is not, thank goodness. It is a tough heart,
and a man&rsquo;s inconstancy and changeableness will never
even make a crack in it. For me to love and grieve
now,&rdquo; and she looked at him straight, &ldquo;a man must be
worth loving and grieving for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the bargain that you want to make, then?&rdquo;
asked John Temple, impatiently, a moment later.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is this: You are a rich man now, and I am your
wife, so I ought to be a rich woman also. I have a
right, you know, to come here if I choose; to claim you
before your new friends; in fact, to make myself generally
disagreeable. But I don&rsquo;t want to do this. I have
my own ideas of happiness, and it is not to force my
company on an unwilling man. But if you will give
me ten thousand pounds I will bring an action of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
divorce against you; I will show the hair you tore out
of my head, and swear to a black bruise or two on my
arms, and perhaps a little playful box on my ears.
Mind, I am not jesting, though I talk as if I were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I refuse your modest request?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, then I must have a big allowance; and I
will talk to everyone of my husband, Mr. John Temple
of Woodlea Hall, and I will buy diamonds and have
them put down to you; in fact, it will be worse for you
than if you give me ten thousand pounds and were
done with me. I really advise you to think it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And John Temple actually stood and did think it
over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me have time to consider,&rdquo; he said, at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which means you will accept my terms,&rdquo; cried Kathleen
Weir, triumphantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad. I really feel
quite friendly toward you, and we must help each other
in this business, you know, and keep our own secrets,
and no one will ever be the wiser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple made no answer; he was thinking that
he would in truth be glad to be free, and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see about getting a good man to manage the
case,&rdquo; went on Kathleen Weir, &ldquo;and I will write to you,
and we must get up the evidence, you know, and have
everything on the square. We&rsquo;ll hoodwink the dear
old judge, and I will play the injured wife to such perfection
that it will be one of my best parts. I&rsquo;m glad
I came to see you, but you&rsquo;re not looking well, my
friend; you are not as good-looking as you were. Well,
never mind, someone, I dare say, will think you good-looking
enough, particularly when she sees your grand
house; though, by the by, you have not yet asked me
into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle&rsquo;s widow is there, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! never mind; I brought a luncheon basket with
me from town, as I did not know whether I could
depend on your hospitality; and, besides, it might look
like collusion if we were caught hobnobbing together.
No one knows of my visit here, and no one need know
of it. I will go straight back to town by the next train,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
and will write all particulars to you as soon as I have
arranged my case, and, as I said before, I shall depend
on your friendly assistance. So now if you will escort
me back to the very shaky hired carriage that I picked
up at the station, I will take leave of Woodlea Hall&mdash;and
its new owner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again she laughed and showed her white teeth, and
without another word John Temple walked by her side
back to the carriage which was waiting for her in the
avenue, and when they reached it he handed her in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; she said, holding his hand for a moment
and looking at him smilingly. &ldquo;Make a better choice
the second time; you are a man who should marry a
woman who thinks you perfection&mdash;I never did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she nodded, smiled again, and was driven away.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XLI.<br />

<small>A WOMAN&rsquo;S OFFER.</small></h2>


<p>She returned to town in the highest spirits, and the
first thing she did was to write to Ralph Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and dine with me to-morrow night,&rdquo; she
wrote. &ldquo;I have some wonderful news to tell you. I
shall be alone, and we will dine at eight.</p>

<p class="right">K. W.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ralph Webster received this tiny note the next morning,
and after a little consideration he determined to
accept her invitation. He naturally felt a strange interest
in Kathleen Weir&rsquo;s proceedings, and wondered what
her news could be; wondered if in any way it could
affect the one woman of whom he ever thought.</p>

<p>He had seen May Churchill the day before, and had
noticed on her fair face a certain new serenity; a new
peace, as if her bitter pain had passed away. And he
had heard also from his friend, Doctor Brentwood, that
the young probationer was learning to be a most excellent
nurse; that she took interest in and studied her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
duties, and that some of the patients had said that her
face was like an angel&rsquo;s as she stood by their bedsides.</p>

<p>May, in truth, was learning something besides nursing.
She was learning the stern, sad lessons of life.
The sick and sorrowing taught her these; taught her
to look beyond the passing joys and hopes of earth.
She knew now that her sorrow had not been greater
than that of others, nor her cross heavier to bear. So
patiently and bravely did she do the work that lay nearest
to her hand.</p>

<p>To Ralph Webster she naturally felt very grateful,
and she had said something of this the last time he had
seen her. But he still had never spoken of his strong,
deep feelings toward her. He had not, in fact, the same
opportunities of doing this at the hospital as he had at
Hastings. But he was only biding his time. &ldquo;Some
day I will try to win her,&rdquo; he told himself each time
he saw her; &ldquo;some day she will forget, and cease to
grieve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was thinking of her as he drove to the flat occupied
by Miss Kathleen Weir; thinking of her, as he
always did, with tender and protecting love. But the
handsome woman who rose to welcome him amid her
flowers and the ornate decorations of her room, naturally
knew nothing of this secret of his heart. Kathleen
Weir received him with smiles and real pleasure. She
looked in his dark, earnest face and compared him mentally
with the man she had seen the day before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is worth winning,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;worth everything&mdash;at
least to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is your wonderful news?&rdquo; asked Webster,
smiling, after they had shaken hands and Kathleen
Weir had once more sank down on the satin couch from
which she had risen at his entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until we have dined,&rdquo; she answered, gaily.
&ldquo;It is so wonderful it would take away your appetite if
we did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, I am content to wait,&rdquo; said Webster, and
a few minutes after dinner was served. It was a luxurious
little meal. Kathleen had spared nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
make it attractive and agreeable, and during it she was
bright and charming, and Webster thought he had
never seen her look so well.</p>

<p>Then, when it was over, she rose in her lithe way
and returned to the drawing-room, followed by Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I am going to give you a great surprise,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;where will you sit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew a chair and placed it near her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am prepared to be surprised,&rdquo; he answered,
with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you will never guess where I was yesterday.
You will never guess who I saw. I went down to
Woodlea Hall; I had a long interview with John Temple,
its new owner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A dark flush rose to Webster&rsquo;s face as he listened to
these words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went, in fact, to try to do a stroke of business, and
I did it. You did not seem inclined to do it for me,
and there was no one else in whom I had absolute trust
but myself. I went to Woodlea for the purpose of seeing
John Temple, and making him a polite offer to get
rid of me. It is a splendid place, and I told him that I
had no idea I had made such a good match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you saw him?&rdquo; said Webster, with a great
effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I saw him. I told him I was quite as
tired of being married to him as he could be of being
married to me. And I told him also it was no use his
trying to get a divorce from me, as he had nothing to
go upon. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;I can get one from you. I
have only to invent that you tore the hair out of my
head, and beat me black and blue, to win my case&rsquo; and
my gentleman did not deny it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely you will not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely I will,&rdquo; went on Kathleen Weir, as Webster
paused and hesitated. &ldquo;However, I have not told
you all. &lsquo;And as you are a rich man,&rsquo; I continued,
&rsquo;you must pay for your freedom. I am ready to swear
falsely; to rid you of a wife to whom you are indifferent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
and who is perfectly indifferent to you, but I
must be paid for it.&rsquo; He made no objections, and I
named the sum I would accept&mdash;ten thousand pounds&mdash;and
to this also he made no objections. Now, don&rsquo;t
you think it was very clever of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;have you any case against him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I have a case, and we can arrange the
particulars between us. He won&rsquo;t deny the hair-pulling
and the beatings, and the judge will believe me to
be an injured woman, and give me the release I am
dying for. I will be free&mdash;free and rich&mdash;and perhaps
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice faltered as she said the last few words, for
the first time during this interview, and her eyes fell.
Webster&rsquo;s eyes also fell, and he moved uneasily, and
then he rose and went toward the fireplace and stood
leaning against the mantel-piece.</p>

<p>Kathleen Weir glanced after him; then also rose and
followed him to where he was standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not think me hard, or cold, or mercenary,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;in making this bargain. I&mdash;I was not thinking
of myself when I did so. I make a large income by my
profession; more than I need. But I wanted this sum&mdash;Ralph
Webster, shall I tell you why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put out her white hand as she spoke, and laid it
on his arm. It was trembling, and Webster saw it
tremble, and an embarrassed silence followed for a few
moments between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you why?&rdquo; she presently repeated, in a
soft, low voice, and she looked up in his face. &ldquo;I
wanted it for you&mdash;for you, for whose sake I wish also
to be free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush, do not speak thus,&rdquo; said Webster, in
great agitation. &ldquo;I thank you very much for your
kindness, your friendship&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; asked Kathleen, quickly, and her face
grew pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;there is a girl, a woman,&rdquo; faltered Webster,
&ldquo;whom I may never marry&mdash;who&mdash;who does not
love me, yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You love her?&rdquo; said Kathleen, with a sort of gasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I shall love no other&mdash;forgive me, Miss
Weir&mdash;but this is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again there was a few moments&rsquo; painful silence, and
then with a strong effort the actress recovered herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there is no harm done,&rdquo; she said, and she
turned away. &ldquo;And for the matter of that,&rdquo; she added,
with a harsh little laugh, &ldquo;I am not divorced yet; I
may never be!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ten minutes later&mdash;after Webster was gone&mdash;Kathleen
Weir was pacing up and down her drawing-room
in a state of intense and concentrated excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I so mad,&rdquo; she said, speaking aloud to herself,
&ldquo;to let this folly utterly upset me? I have wasted my
affections then for the second time, but it won&rsquo;t kill me!
Webster shall not think he has broken my heart any
more than the other one did. Yet I like him,&rdquo; and her
face softened; &ldquo;he has a great heart&mdash;and the girl, the
woman, whoever she is, may be proud of her conquest.
But I am not going to pine; life isn&rsquo;t long
enough to waste on a vain regret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this she went back into the room where they
had dined and took up one of the half-emptied champagne
bottles and poured some of it into a glass and
drank it. Then she rang the bell and ordered her
brougham to come around for her in half an hour, and
having done that she sat down to her desk and wrote
and dispatched telegrams to Linda Falconer, to Lord
Dereham, and to two other men that she knew, inviting
them to supper that evening at half-past eleven o&rsquo;clock.
Presently she sent out and ordered an elaborate supper
to be sent in from a confectioner&rsquo;s; ordered everything
she could think of; the most expensive luxuries she
could buy.</p>

<p>When she had completed her arrangements she drove
to one of the theaters to pass the time until her expected
guests would arrive. A man she knew joined her there,
and she invited him also to return with her to supper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
She seemed in the wildest spirits; she laughed and
jested, and showed her white teeth; all the while a cold
sharp pang lay pressing on her heart.</p>

<p>The supper was a great success, and never had Kathleen
Weir been so witty or so gay. She sang, she
coquetted, and played her part so well that Linda Falconer
looked at her with her shadowed, dreamy eyes,
and asked her if she had come into a fortune.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the prospect of one, at all events,&rdquo; answered
Kathleen; &ldquo;and there is nothing like money, you know,
Linda&mdash;nothing, nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think there is something better than money,&rdquo; said
Dereham, with his honest brown eyes fixed on Linda
Falconer&rsquo;s lovely face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean love!&rdquo; And Kathleen Weir shrugged
her white shoulders. &ldquo;My friend, that is because you
are young and innocent. Love is a delusion, a pitfall
into which we stumble only to find it full of disappointments.
We love a man or a woman whom at the time
we think perfection, but it is not the true man or woman,
but an idealized creature of our own imaginations. We
find this out when it is too late, and we blame the unfortunate
recipient of our deluded affections, not our own
folly in being deluded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe in love,&rdquo; answered Dereham, sturdily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long may you believe in it, then,&rdquo; said Kathleen,
with a light laugh. &ldquo;But, Dereham, you won&rsquo;t. You
too will wake up and find your idol shattered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How spiteful you are, Kathleen!&rdquo; remarked Linda
Falconer, calmly. &ldquo;Have you had a disappointment in
love lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear, for I have not been in love. I love
myself too well to waste my affections on an ungrateful
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you might find a grateful one?&rdquo; said one of her
friends, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt it, greatly. However, I do not mean to try.
I mean to amuse myself, and if you are always thinking
of one person it is impossible to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She talked in this strain a little longer and then rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
and went to the piano, and presently her wonderfully
clear and ringing voice filled the room. The men present
stood around her, except Lord Dereham, who
remained in the supper-room with Linda Falconer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How excited Kathleen Weir is to-night! Do you
think she has taken too much champagne?&rdquo; remarked
Linda of her friend.</p>

<p>Dereham laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but that was all rot she
talked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean about love?&rdquo; asked Linda, softly, and
for a moment she looked in Dereham&rsquo;s face, and then
cast down her beautiful eyes with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, ardently, and he bent forward
and took her white hand. &ldquo;I believe in it&mdash;and&mdash;and
Linda, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;try not to think of it,&rdquo; she half-whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;ah, Dereham, you must not ask;&rdquo; and
again she sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do ask, and I want you to answer me. Why
do you try not to think of love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;the&mdash;the person I could love is not as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His rank is different to mine,&rdquo; answered Linda, in a
low, sad tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His rank! What has rank to do with it? If a man
really loves he never thinks of these things. Linda,
who is the person you could love? Will you tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Linda looked in his face, and their eyes met;
Linda&rsquo;s said very plainly&mdash;at least she intended them
to say&mdash;&ldquo;You are the person I could love&rdquo;; and thus
Dereham understood their meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then do love me, dearest,&rdquo; he said, bending
closer, and half-whispering in her ear. &ldquo;Let my rank
be yours; your life be mine&mdash;be my wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Linda Falconer smiled gently as she listened to the
words. She had wished to listen to them for some little
while, but she had not been in a hurry. She was too
wise, too cold, to allow the young man to think she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
in any haste to receive his proposal. But as he had
proposed, she was also too wise to allow the opportunity
to pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are you sure, quite sure, of your own heart?&rdquo;
she asked, pensively. &ldquo;You heard what Kathleen Weir
said&mdash;and&mdash;and unless you really love me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do most deeply, most truly; I have thought of this
almost ever since I met you, but I was never sure of
you; you do not make a rush at a fellow like some women
do, and&mdash;and though I was afraid I liked you all the
better for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made this ingenious confession to a woman who
knew very well he was speaking the truth. She had
intended to win this young lord, and she had won him,
and no doubt had done it cleverly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was afraid too,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;afraid to love
you&mdash;at least to show my love&mdash;but not now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And before the party broke up she had time to whisper
her news to Kathleen Weir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all settled,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we are engaged,&rdquo; and
her eyes were bright with triumph.</p>

<p>Kathleen Weir listened, and somehow another
woman&rsquo;s success and happiness gave her a fresh pang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So this cold, selfish woman has won, and I have
lost,&rdquo; she thought, bitterly, after her guests had left
her. All her high spirits had now died away; she sat
wearily down, but after a while returned to the supper-room
and drank several glasses of champagne to
benumb the aching pain at her heart. As a rule, she
was a very sober woman, and the unusual quantity of
wine that she had taken quickly affected her. She
walked, but not very steadily, back into the drawing-room,
and as she did so her foot tripped on a cushion
that someone had accidentally thrown and left on the
floor. She stumbled, and to save herself from falling
caught hold of a brass floor-lamp, and in doing so overturned
it. And in an instant&mdash;before her first agonized
cry could escape her lips&mdash;the burning oil
streamed over her bare neck, throat, and arms, and the
light dress that she wore was in flames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>She uttered shriek after shriek, and ran&mdash;a burning
mass&mdash;to the door of the room. A gentleman who
lived in the flat above her heard her cries and quickly
came to her assistance. He promptly wrapped her in
a coverlet that he caught up, and succeeded, after a few
minutes, in crushing out the cruel flames; but she was
terribly burned, and the decorated room where the accident
occurred, which she had made so bright with
flowers when she had awaited Webster&rsquo;s coming, was
one blackened ruin ere the fire died out.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XLII.<br />

<small>WEBSTER&rsquo;S STRUGGLE.</small></h2>


<p>Late in the afternoon of the following day, as Webster
was leaving one of the law courts where he had
been pleading, a gentleman, a stranger, touched his
arm and addressed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Mr. Webster, the barrister, are you not?&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Webster, looking up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Doctor Lynton,&rdquo; continued the gentleman, who
was a grave-faced, middle-aged man. &ldquo;I have been to
your chambers at the Temple to seek you, and have
followed you here. I have come from Miss Kathleen
Weir, the actress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An annoyed expression passed over Webster&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have come on a sad errand,&rdquo; went on Doctor
Lynton. &ldquo;A terrible accident happened to Miss Weir
last night, and she is lying now in, I fear&mdash;nay, I more
than fear, I know&mdash;a hopeless condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shocked exclamation broke from Webster&rsquo;s lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She accidentally overturned one of those tall floor-lamps,
and is dreadfully burned. And she wishes to
see you; she sent me to say she wishes to see you before
she dies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Webster. &ldquo;Do you mean
to tell me there is no hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Conscientiously, I can hold out none,&rdquo; answered the
doctor. &ldquo;It is, indeed, a sad case. But can you go to
her now? My brougham is waiting for me, and I am
going to drive straight back to her house, and if you will
come with me I shall be glad&mdash;for, poor soul, I fear she
is drifting fast away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said Webster, unutterably shocked. It
seemed almost impossible, this sudden change. The
bright woman of last night; the gay rooms, the jests,
the laughter, and now to hear of the approaching end.</p>

<p>He scarcely spoke after he entered the doctor&rsquo;s carriage.
He covered his face with one of his hands, and
sat thinking what the death of Kathleen Weir might
mean. A fair face&mdash;sweet, serene, and sad&mdash;rose
before his mental vision, and unconsciously a sort of
groan broke from his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know her well?&rdquo; asked the doctor, in a
commiserating tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean Miss Weir?&rdquo; answered Webster, trying
to rouse himself. &ldquo;Yes, I have known her for some
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has seen her lawyer,&rdquo; continued the doctor,
&ldquo;and made her will. But I do not suppose she has
much to leave; these actresses as a rule spend their
money as fast as they get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Webster, indifferently, for he
was not thinking of the actress&rsquo; will.</p>

<p>The doctor after this made a remark occasionally,
and Webster just replied; and presently the carriage
stopped before the handsome mansion where poor
Kathleen Weir&rsquo;s flat was situated. Her own rooms
were wrecked, almost everything in them having been
destroyed before the fire was extinguished. But they
had carried her to another flat in the same house, and
to a darkened chamber in this suite of rooms the doctor
now proceeded, followed by Webster, who was
deeply moved.</p>

<p>The doctor faintly rapped when they reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
door of the apartment where Kathleen lay, and it was
immediately opened by a professional nurse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you have come, doctor,&rdquo; she whispered;
&ldquo;she is very restless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the doctor went into the room and approached
the bedside, and the moment Kathleen saw him she
said, in a faint, low voice, which Webster heard:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you brought him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the doctor, gently; &ldquo;he is here.
Mr. Webster, will you come and speak to Miss Weir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this Webster, with faltering footsteps, also
approached the bed, where, swathed and bandaged, lay
the once lovely form of Kathleen Weir!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Send everyone away, doctor,&rdquo; continued Kathleen,
in the same faint, low tone; &ldquo;I wish to speak to Mr.
Webster alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor and the nurse at once left the room, and
then Kathleen spoke to Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a great change,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Webster was deeply agitated, and his voice broke and
faltered as he strove to express his regret and sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It came so suddenly,&rdquo; continued Kathleen; &ldquo;like a
bad dream&mdash;only there was no waking from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; asked Webster, much moved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tripped and fell over a cushion someone had left
lying on the floor, and to save myself caught at a lamp
and overturned it. I was like a mad creature last
night, I think. After you left I went to the theater,
and had people to supper, and we made merry, when&mdash;well,
Mr. Webster, I seemed to care for nothing more;
when the world seemed for me&mdash;as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush, hush! do not speak thus, I entreat you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you have nothing to blame yourself for, at
least. You acted like an honest man, and I admired
you when&mdash;you gave me a blow that was far more
bitter than you guessed of. But it is all over now.
John Temple will be free without his divorce; and if it
was money that parted you from the girl or woman you
cared for, it need part you no longer&mdash;for I have left
you all I have to leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Weir&mdash;Kathleen! Why have you done this?
I want no money; I can not take it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must, my friend; do not talk nonsense&mdash;what
good can it do me now? Yes, it does do me some
good, to be able thus to show you what I really think
of you; to mark how I estimate you&mdash;and if it makes
you happy even with someone else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No money will make me happy&mdash;it was not
money,&rdquo; answered Webster with inexpressible pain in
his face. It flashed across his mind indeed at this
moment that the very death of this wayward, generous
heart would end all his hopes; would leave John Temple
free.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events, I hope you will be happy&mdash;some
day,&rdquo; went on Kathleen, after a little pause; &ldquo;so I sent
for you to tell you this, and&mdash;to bid you good-by. But
I don&rsquo;t believe it will be forever. I have a vague foreshadowing
of another life&mdash;another and a better one&mdash;even
for a poor sinner like me. And after all, one
is often tired here&mdash;tired by the shams and follies&mdash;I
feel tired now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice sank into a whisper as she uttered these
last words, and then died away. Webster bent nearer,
and then grew alarmed. He rang the bell, and the
doctor and nurse reappeared, and Webster left the
room, but not the house. A profound feeling of melancholy
seemed to come over him. A sense of desolation
filled his heart. The door of poor Kathleen&rsquo;s
wrecked drawing-room was slightly ajar, and he went
in and looked around. The flames had blackened and
spoilt everything, and the water poured in by the firemen
had completed the ruin. He thought of her as
she had sat there yesterday&mdash;a bright, smiling, handsome
woman&mdash;and he thought of her now. And her
generous words! Her having remembered him amid her
own agony touched his very soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she little knows, poor Kathleen&mdash;she little
knows!&rdquo; he murmured, half-aloud, as he gazed at the
desolate scene.</p>

<p>And then he asked himself what he must do. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
Kathleen died, John Temple would be free; free to right
the wrong that he had done&mdash;but would he do it? Naturally
Webster thought ill of John Temple, and was not
sure how he would act when he heard the wife was dead
whom he had forsaken. And then, Temple knew not
where to find May. &ldquo;No one knows where to find her
but myself,&rdquo; reflected Webster, and a great struggle
took place in his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I again destroy the peace that is just dawning?
tell her the man who treated her so vilely is now able
to marry her if he will? It would be cruel, and yet, on
the other hand, what right have I to judge for her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>None, Webster told himself, as he paced restlessly up
and down the deserted room. If May still cared for
Temple, he had no right to stand between them; no
right to think of his own happiness in comparison to
hers.</p>

<p>He was still thinking thus when Doctor Lynton
entered the room, and Webster looked quickly in his
face as he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has revived a little for the present,&rdquo; said the doctor,
in answer to the unspoken question written on
Webster&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;But the action of her heart is
extremely weak, arising from the shock to the system,
and she will not live over the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster heard this verdict in silence; but the fleeting
breath was not stayed even as long as the doctor had
thought. A few minutes later the nurse entered the
room and addressed Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor lady upstairs, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has something
to give you before she goes, and I think it won&rsquo;t
be long now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it do her any harm my seeing her?&rdquo; asked Webster,
looking at the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing will do her any harm,&rdquo; answered the doctor,
gravely; &ldquo;from the first there was no hope; and it is
only from the original strength and vitality of her constitution
that she has lasted so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Webster returned to the bedside of the dying
woman, and even during the short time of his absence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
her voice was weaker. It was indeed only a husky
whisper now, and he had to bend over her very closely
to understand what she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want you to have this ring&mdash;this ring,&rdquo; and a
bandaged hand crept out toward Webster&rsquo;s, who took it
gently in his own, and stooping down kissed it. &ldquo;Keep
it for my sake,&rdquo; went on those husky tones; &ldquo;and if you
see John Temple&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the next moment she gave a kind of cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this? What new pain is this?&rdquo; she gasped
out. &ldquo;Lift me up&mdash;I am choking&mdash;lift me up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both the doctor and Webster at once raised her in
their arms, but after a few gasping sighs, she indicated
that she wished to lie back again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;is&mdash;all over,&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;and&mdash;I die as I
wished&mdash;with my hand in yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were her last words; there were a few faint
struggles, a few long, low sighs, and then all was still.
But to the end Webster kept her poor maimed hand in
his, and when it was all over he again bent down and
kissed it, and when he raised his head his eyes were dim
with unshed tears.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Late that night he sat alone in his chambers pondering
still on how he should act. A hard and bitter
struggle was warring in his heart; how hard and bitter
he only knew. Unconsciously almost to himself he had
begun to hope that some day he would win May
Churchill for his wife; that some day she might return
his love. He was not a man to love lightly, nor one to
change. His feelings were characteristic, strong, and
undivided; his life high-toned and pure. Until he had
seen May&rsquo;s flower-like face he had loved no woman,
and indeed scarcely had given the sex a thought. His
profession, his career, had occupied his whole time, and
he hardly knew that there lay a hidden fire in his breast,
which had kindled and burst forth at the beauty of a
country girl.</p>

<p>Now he did not deceive himself. He knew during
that dark struggle in the midnight hours when Kathleen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
Weir lay dead, that if he gave May up he gave up
also the best hopes of his manhood, the one love of his
life. But after a stout fight with the opposing passions
of his heart, the nobler part of his nature conquered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I not give her back happiness at the cost of
my own?&rdquo; he determined. &ldquo;I will go to him, and if
he is a cur, she shall never know; if not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face was very gray and pale, but he had made up
his mind. He would see John Temple, and he and May
must decide their fate.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.<br />

<small>STRANGE NEWS.</small></h2>


<p>The next day was a wet and dreary one, almost a
storm. The wind sighed through the budding trees at
Woodlea Hall, and the rain beat against the window
panes. A bright fire was, however, burning in the library
during the afternoon, and the new master, John Temple,
was there, and Mrs. Temple, the widow of the old
one.</p>

<p>John Temple was smoking endless cigarettes and
reading. He was nearly always smoking now, and Mrs.
Temple declared she delighted in the smell of tobacco.
She in truth delighted to be in John Temple&rsquo;s company,
and nearly always contrived to be so.</p>

<p>Presently John Temple rose from his easy chair and
flung the remains of his last cigarette into the grate,
and having lit a new one began walking restlessly up
and down the long room, and Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s dark eyes
followed his tall, slight form as he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of, John?&rdquo; at last she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; he answered somewhat listlessly; &ldquo;the
wind disquiets me, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a storm,&rdquo; she said, and then she also rose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
went first to one of the windows of the room and looked
out. Presently she turned around and joined John
Temple, and slid her hand through his arm and began
walking by his side.</p>

<p>She had scarcely done this, however, when they both
heard the sound of carriage wheels approaching up
the avenue, and a minute or so later the hall doorbell
rang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a bore!&rdquo; exclaimed John Temple. &ldquo;If it is
any visitors, say I&rsquo;m out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she answered, but still remained by his
side. A few moments later, however, a footman rapped
at the room door and then entered, carrying a salver
on which lay a card, which he presented to his new
master.</p>

<p>John Temple put out his hand carelessly and took it
up, but the instant he saw the printed name a quick
change came over his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Temple, sharply, who had
noticed the change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man I wish to see&mdash;you may show him in here,&rdquo;
he went on, addressing the footman; &ldquo;and perhaps
you,&rdquo; and he looked at Mrs. Temple, &ldquo;if you do not
mind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish me to go?&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple, quickly.
&ldquo;Very well, I will&mdash;only do nothing rash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple made no answer to this, and then Mrs.
Temple quitted the room, and in the hall she passed a
tall, dark man, who was being ushered to the library by
the footman.</p>

<p>And a moment later Ralph Webster entered the
room. He bowed gravely to John Temple, who also
bowed, and a slight flush rose to his face as he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Mr. John Temple, I presume?&rdquo; then said
Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come on a strange errand, Mr. Temple,&rdquo; continued
Webster; &ldquo;but I have come because I believe it
to be my duty to do so. I am the nephew of two ladies
whom you used to know; of the ladies to whose care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
you confided the young lady whom you afterward married
from their house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple bowed his head; his face contracted as
if with pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said in a low tone. &ldquo;Have&mdash;have
you anything to tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster hesitated for a moment and then went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew this young lady; I met her at my aunts&rsquo;, and
I knew you also by name, and had been told of your
marriage. But in the course of my professional career
I met another lady&mdash;Miss Kathleen Weir&mdash;and from
her I learned the early history of her life and her connection
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Temple&rsquo;s lip curled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has she sent you to me?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I presume
you know she came here, and wished to make some
arrangement?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; answered Webster, gravely. &ldquo;No,
she has not sent me here&mdash;Miss Kathleen Weir is
dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead! impossible!&rdquo; cried John Temple, and his
face grew pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She died yesterday afternoon; an accident had
occurred the night before, and she overturned a lamp
and was terribly burned. I was with her when she
died; I saw her die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God! I can not believe it!&rdquo; exclaimed Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nevertheless true&mdash;and I, knowing of her
marriage to you&mdash;knowing also of your other marriage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you got to say to me, sir?&rdquo; interrupted
Temple, quickly. &ldquo;I am denying nothing; but what
have you got to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; answered Webster, with quiet dignity.
&ldquo;When I heard of your first marriage I knew that you
had also contracted a second marriage, and that&mdash;the
young lady was living under my aunts&rsquo; roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Temple, sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I could not&mdash;I did not feel that I was called
upon to tell this&mdash;to destroy her happiness.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>Unconsciously Webster&rsquo;s voice faltered as he uttered
the last few words, and Temple looked at him with
eager anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you yourself told the secret,&rdquo; went on Webster,
recovering himself; &ldquo;you told this young girl what
well-nigh broke her heart&mdash;that she was no wife&mdash;that
she was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be silent! How dare you speak thus!&rdquo; cried John
Temple, hoarsely and passionately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I speak for a purpose,&rdquo; continued Webster; &ldquo;you
told her of your early marriage to Miss Weir; and in
her despair, her sudden shame and anguish, she left you,
never intending to see you more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple sprang forward; he grasped Webster&rsquo;s
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything?&rdquo; he gasped out. &ldquo;Do you
know if&mdash;she lives?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Temple, she lives. That night, after she
left the hotel in her despair, by chance I saw her; she
looked so ill, so strange, that I, knowing her story,
followed her. I followed her to Westminster bridge,
and then&mdash;when she was very ill&mdash;when she was
unconscious, I took her to St. Phillip&rsquo;s Hospital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she is living? Oh! thank God! Thank God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no doubting his great thankfulness, and
Webster&rsquo;s voice softened a little as he went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is living, and now nearly well. She went
through a long and dangerous illness, and at times we
almost despaired of her life. But at last her youth
reasserted itself, though only on one condition did she
struggle feebly back to life. And this condition was
that her very existence had to be kept an absolute
secret; she wished everyone to believe her dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment John Temple did not speak; his lips
quivered; he turned away his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised faithfully to keep her secret,&rdquo; continued
Webster; &ldquo;no one knew at the hospital who she was
but myself, and I have kept it until now&mdash;until after
the death of Kathleen Weir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she left me to endure all this misery&mdash;a bitter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
unending remorse and regret,&rdquo; now said John Temple,
in a broken, agitated voice. &ldquo;She&mdash;who said she
loved me&mdash;who said that we could not live apart&mdash;it
seems that she could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Temple, you are unjust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be so, but&mdash;it was not thus that I regarded
her. However, if your news be true&mdash;if poor Kathleen
is indeed dead&mdash;I will, of course, at once remarry May.
She knows, I suppose, that you are here; knows why
you came?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knows nothing. I have not seen her since Miss
Weir&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where is she living now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At St. Phillip&rsquo;s Hospital. She has never left it.
She is now one of the nursing sisters there; she insisted
on working for her daily bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a few moments after this Temple did not speak.
He stood with knitted brows as if in thought. Then
he held out his hand to Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very grateful to you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;grateful to
you for coming to tell me all this; and for your kindness&mdash;to
the poor girl to whom I did so great a wrong.
But I will be honest with you; I believed May loved me
so well that even had I told her of that early tie&mdash;broken
years ago&mdash;that she still would have shared my
fortunes. I judged her feelings by my own&mdash;but it
seems I was mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster did not speak; he cast down his eyes; an
angry throb passed through his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, we need not speak of this,&rdquo; continued
Temple after a moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;There is now but
one course for me to take, which is at once to go to her,
and for us to be immediately remarried. Her father
is in London at this very time seeking her&mdash;he did not
believe as I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still Webster was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall, therefore,&rdquo; went on John Temple, &ldquo;at once
telegraph to him that she is safe and well. As for you,
Mr. Webster, I do not know how to thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need no thanks,&rdquo; answered Webster a little hoarsely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the highest regard and liking for your aunts,
and I hope now my poor little May will welcome them
here. And you&mdash;you will dine and stay all night
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Webster shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must return by the next train to
town; my mission here is ended&mdash;I will see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May? Then I will travel with you. Yes, kindly see
her, and break the news to her of poor Kathleen&rsquo;s
death. But I feel yet as if I can scarcely forgive May.
If she wished to leave me she might have done so; not
cost me such bitter pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will not discuss it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is useless. And now, Mr. Webster, will you
kindly excuse me for a few minutes? I will ring for
some refreshments for you, and if you really must
return by the next train to town, it passes our station at
a quarter to six;&rdquo; and John Temple looked at his watch.
&ldquo;I will go with you, and to-morrow&mdash;you will see
May?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that is all settled. I will rejoin you in a few
minutes; I wish to tell my news to my uncle&rsquo;s widow,
and, Mr. Webster, I may depend on your honor, I am
sure, to keep all this a secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may quite depend upon me,&rdquo; answered Webster,
a little bitterly.</p>

<p>After this John Temple left the room, and went
straight to the morning-room, where he expected to
find Mrs. Temple. She was there, looking pale and
agitated, and she went forward quickly to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that gentleman, John?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have
been feeling quite anxious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has brought me strange news, Rachel,&rdquo; answered
John Temple, gravely. He called her now by her
Christian name, as she had expressed a wish that he
should do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Strange news?&rdquo; she repeated, and her face grew
paler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; May is alive&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what will you do?&rdquo; asked the agitated woman
before him, almost with a gasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is but one thing for me to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go to her; we must be remarried&mdash;for I
have other news for you; this gentleman, Mr. Webster,
has brought me other news&mdash;my first wife, Kathleen
Weir, is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A half-cry broke from Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s white lips, and
that was all. She stood there with wide-open eyes and
heaving breast. John Temple&rsquo;s news was a death-blow
to her new hopes of happiness and love, but still she
could speak no word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; went on John Temple, scarcely daring to
look at her white face, &ldquo;that this Mr. Webster knew all
the time where May was&mdash;at some hospital or other&mdash;but
by May&rsquo;s especial wish he kept this a secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she calls this love!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Temple, wildly
and passionately. &ldquo;Love! to make you endure such
pain; to make your life a burden; each day a fresh
pang! If this is love, I know not what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems strange,&rdquo; said John Temple, and then
without another word he went away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour or so later two men were sitting in the same
railway carriage together traveling to town, but they
were not talking of the loves or the tragedies of their
lives. They were talking gravely of the passing topics
of the day, of politics, of books, and the names of May
Churchill and Kathleen Weir were never once mentioned
between them. Not at least until they reached
the terminus and were about to separate for the night.
Then as they shook hands, John Temple said quietly:
&ldquo;At what time will you see May in the morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Early,&rdquo; answered Webster; &ldquo;about eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then will you telegraph to me, and I will go to her?
I will also see her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo; hesitated Webster; &ldquo;what will you say to
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best tell him the truth, I think, and Mr. Churchill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
will see the wisdom and prudence of keeping it to himself.
Besides he had better be present at our marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my aunts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any reason to say anything to them? They
know nothing, and they may as well continue in ignorance
of a painful story. And now again many
thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they parted, and Webster went back to his lonely
chambers, and thought of what he had done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is for her happiness,&rdquo; and then he sighed
wearily; somehow he was not quite sure that it would
be.</p>

<p>And early the next morning he sent a telegram to
May at St. Phillip&rsquo;s Hospital to say he would be with her
by eleven o&rsquo;clock. May received this telegram with great
surprise, for Webster never wrote to her, nor sent telegrams,
and when he called it was generally late in the
afternoon. But precisely at eleven o&rsquo;clock a message
was sent to her that Mr. Webster was waiting to see
her in the sitting-room of the house surgeon, Doctor
Brentwood.</p>

<p>She accordingly went there, and found Webster
standing, looking grave and pale, and so ill that she
instantly remarked on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not well, Mr. Webster?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
do not look at all well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster scarcely answered her; he had taken her
hand, and stood looking in her fair face, and there was
great pain and trouble in his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some news for you, May,&rdquo; he said at length.</p>

<p>He had never before called her &ldquo;May,&rdquo; and she
noticed this and blushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;News?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Not bad news, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twice he opened his lips, but somehow no words
came forth. And his manner was so strange that May
grew really alarmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh! you frighten me&mdash;has
anything happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then with a great effort he told her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May, Kathleen Weir is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>The blood rushed to May&rsquo;s face as she listened to
these words, and then died away, leaving her very
pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; she repeated; and in an instant it flashed
across her mind all that this might mean to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Webster, trying to speak calmly,
&ldquo;she died the day before yesterday. It was an accident;
she was burned to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&mdash;and does&mdash;he know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; again answered Webster. &ldquo;I saw him yesterday&mdash;it
was but right that he should know&mdash;he is
coming to you to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May gave a little cry; a little start, as if she were
half afraid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is for your happiness,&rdquo; continued Webster with
faltering lips, &ldquo;otherwise, of course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment or two May did not speak. She stood
as if thinking, as if in doubt. Then suddenly she held
out her hand to Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is but right,&rdquo; she said, speaking with an effort.
&ldquo;And you&mdash;how am I to thank you for all you have
done for me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster&rsquo;s lips quivered. He tried to say some commonplace
words. He stooped down and kissed her
trembling hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your happiness is&mdash;everything to me,&rdquo; he faltered.
&ldquo;I have thought of that alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And somehow at this moment she understood something
of the unspoken feelings of his heart. One of
those glimpses into another&rsquo;s soul which came unsought
passed through hers. She trembled; she drew away
her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May God bless you,&rdquo; murmured Webster, and the
next moment he was gone. And he left May strangely
disturbed. His constant kindness, his generosity in
word and deed, and now his unselfish love, moved her
deeply. But she had not much time for thought. She
had scarcely indeed returned to her duties in the
wards when another message was brought to her that
a second visitor was waiting for her in the house surgeon&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
room, and the moment she heard this she knew
who it would be.</p>

<p>It was in truth John Temple; and as she entered the
room pale, nervous, beautiful, he advanced toward her
and took her in his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could you give me all that bitter pain, May?&rdquo;
were his first words, and then he bent down and kissed
her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know that I am free now,&rdquo; he said, presently.
&ldquo;I have seen your father, and have arranged with him
that we shall be married again immediately. But May,
I will never believe that you really loved me now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with eyes full of reproach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I meant to die,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;But for Mr.
Webster&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not, please, speak of it; you are looking very
well; as pretty as ever, I think, May; and you must
forget all this like a bad dream. Do you know my
poor uncle is dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of it; I have lived here, and&mdash;never
spoken of the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is dead, poor man; he died quite suddenly, and
I was recalled to England in consequence. I am
living at Woodlea now, and you must go there, May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! it seems so strange&mdash;all so strange, John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her hand half-timidly into his as she spoke,
and as she said it was all so strange. A long lifetime
appeared to lie between her and the early days of her
fond love and happiness. She looked up in John&rsquo;s
face; it seemed changed, too, but he was very kind and
gentle to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must change this becoming dress,&rdquo; he said,
smiling, and laying his hand on her black gown. &ldquo;The
cap suits you charmingly, but it won&rsquo;t do for you now,
you know. You will want some money, May, so I have
brought it for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how can you talk of such things&mdash;just when
we have met again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My child, it was your own fault that we ever
parted. However, we had best agree to drop this subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
forever; no one knows of it but one person, and
for my sake I think she will keep the secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;my father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was forced to tell him a garbled sort of story,
but, of course, we may depend on his secrecy. He will
be present at your second wedding, May, and will give
you away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May gave a tremulous little sigh. She was remembering
her first wedding, and her infinite love and
trust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father will be here presently, I expect,&rdquo; went
on John Temple, &ldquo;and I think you had better stay
with him until we are married. We can be married the
day after to-morrow by special license, but not to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not to-morrow! for John Temple knew that on the
morrow Kathleen Weir was to be laid in her untimely
grave. He did not mean to follow her there; to him
for long years she had been a burden and encumbrance.
But all the same he did not choose to marry
on her burial day.</p>

<p>But he did not tell May this, and while he was still
talking of their future arrangements Mr. Churchill
arrived. Both May and he were much affected at this
meeting. Mr. Churchill caught his &ldquo;little girl&rdquo; in his
arms and kissed her again and again, with something
like a tear glistening in his brown eyes. John Temple
had not told him the whole story of his first marriage;
he had told him, however, that there was some flaw in
the marriage to May, and that they had better be married
again, and that Mr. Churchill also had better be
present. And though Mr. Churchill was an affectionate
father, and really fond of May, he was also a tenant.
John Temple was his landlord, and it behooved him,
as a prudent man, to make the best of the situation.
He, therefore, accepted the explanation he was offered,
and gladly agreed to keep the whole affair of the
second marriage a secret at Woodside.</p>

<p>Thus everything was very soon arranged between
the two men, and before the day was over May left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
home that had sheltered her in her cruel need. But
both John Temple and Mr. Churchill gave gifts to the
hospital&mdash;John Temple, lavishly; Mr. Churchill, prudently.
And May also slid a handsome sum into the
kindly hand of Sister Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are going to be married to this other gentleman,&rdquo;
said Sister Margaret, rather in a disappointed
tone. &ldquo;Well, I thought it would have been Mr. Webster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! hush, hush!&rdquo; said May, quickly; &ldquo;Mr. Webster
never thought of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am almost certain he did, though I have had so
little experience in lovers,&rdquo; replied Sister Margaret.
&ldquo;Well, my dear, whoever it is, I only hope you may be
happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So with the good wishes of all she had known, May
quitted St. Phillip&rsquo;s and went with her father to the
hotel at which he was staying. And the next two days
were very busy ones, for May had a whole wardrobe to
purchase, and John Temple was very generous. And
on the night before their marriage, when they were sitting
together, John Temple suddenly put his arm round
her and drew her to his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are you happy now? quite
happy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, softly; &ldquo;and very grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She meant to God, but John Temple did not understand
her, and kissed her very tenderly.</p>

<p>And early the next morning they were married, and
Mr. Churchill felt sure at least that this time there was
no mistake. And he was a proud and happy man as he
gave his young daughter to John Temple, though not
so elated as he had been when he returned to Woodside
after seeing the register of their first marriage. And
scarcely had the bride and bridegroom started to spend
a few days at Brighton before going to Woodlea when
Mr. Churchill sat down and wrote the following letter
to his wife:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sarah</span>: I shall be back to-morrow by the
first train, and I am happy to say the business that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
came up to London for is now all satisfactorily settled.
May had had a slight disagreement with her husband,
and, like a foolish girl, quarreled with him. But it is all
made up now, and I think in about a week at latest
they will be going down to the Hall, and then I hope
we shall often see them. May sends her love to you&rdquo;&mdash;here
Mr. Churchill did not quite adhere to the truth&mdash;&rdquo;and
to the boys, and best let all bygones be bygones.
May is now Mrs. Temple of Woodlea Hall, and can hold
her head up with the best of them; and Mr. John Temple,
besides being my son-in-law, is my landlord, and I
therefore naturally wish to keep on good terms with
him. I have bought you a new silk gown, and I hope
you will like it. And I remain,</p>

<p class="signoff">&ldquo;Your affectionate husband,</p>

<p class="right">&rdquo;<span class="smcap">William Churchill</span>.&ldquo;</p>

<p>John Temple wrote a letter before he left town to
tell Mrs. Temple of his marriage, a letter which she
received with deep emotion.</p>

<p>&rdquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Rachel</span>: I was remarried this morning to
May, and Mr. Churchill was present. And now I am
going to ask you for the sake of the friendship you have
shown me, to keep the unhappy story I confided to you
and this second marriage a secret. No good would
come of telling it, and no one knows it but yourself, Mr.
Webster (whom I can trust), and May&rsquo;s father. Let us,
therefore, try to forget it; but I shall not forget your
kindness to me during the unhappy time when I first
returned to Woodlea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there is another thing that I wish to mention
to you, which is that once or twice you have talked of
the Hall as my house, and of your leaving it. I hope
that you will do nothing of the sort, and that you will
always regard it as your home. Independently of the
pleasure that your company will give me, you will, of
course, be the greatest advantage and assistance to my
poor little May in her new position. She is looking
very well, and is very sweet and gentle, but I fear her
people will be somewhat of a trial. However, we must
make the best of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going down to Brighton for a few days, and
I will then return to Woodlea about to-day week, I think.
But I will let you know when to expect us. And with
kind regards, I remain,</p>

<p class="signoff">&ldquo;Very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="right">&rdquo;<span class="smcap">John Temple</span>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;P. S.&mdash;Above all things say nothing to your mother.</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;J. T.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.<br />

<small>MAY&rsquo;S NEW HOME.</small></h2>


<p>One evening nearly a fortnight after Mrs. Temple
had received the letter from John Temple announcing
his marriage to May, the windows of Woodlea Hall
were all alight in expectation of their return.</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple had been in a state of great, though
suppressed, excitement all day. The rooms were bright
with flowers, and by her orders the whole place was
arranged to appear to the best advantage. As for Mrs.
Temple herself she wore an evening dress of black
velvet, having discarded her deep mourning in honor
of the occasion.</p>

<p>Yet she was feeling far from happy. This girl, this
stranger, who was coming to take her place, she thought,
she naturally regarded with hidden though deep resentment.
John Temple could not have acted otherwise,
she told herself, but this did not lessen the bitterness
of her heart.</p>

<p>And when at last the carriage which contained John
Temple and his young wife drove up to the entrance of
the Hall, Mrs. Temple went forward, pale, handsome,
and agitated, to receive them. She clasped John&rsquo;s
hand first, who warmly shook hers, and then&mdash;as
though half-unwillingly&mdash;she looked at the fair girlish
face by his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is May,&rdquo; said John Temple, in kindly tones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
&ldquo;May, my dear, this is Mrs. Temple, my poor uncle&rsquo;s
widow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two women shook hands after this, and exchanged
a few remarks on the journey and the weather. May
felt embarrassed and slightly overawed by this handsome
woman who looked at her so coldly. It was not
like going to her own home, somehow, she felt. John
indeed referred to Mrs. Temple about everything, and
showed his uncle&rsquo;s widow the greatest consideration
and respect.</p>

<p>And when an hour or so afterward dinner was
announced, John Temple smilingly offered one arm to
Mrs. Temple and the other to May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must do double duty to-night, you see,&rdquo; he said;
and when they reached the dining-room he deliberately
led Mrs. Temple to the head of the table, and indicated
to May to sit at the side. But Mrs. Temple drew back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is your wife&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; answered John Temple, decidedly;
&ldquo;this is your place, as it always has been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple said nothing more at this time; she sat
opposite to John, and May, without any feeling of anger
in her heart, took the chair her husband had assigned
to her. She was looking very pretty, but somehow
Mrs. Temple could not understand the expression of
her face. There was no elation there, nor pride in her
new position. Now when the first nervousness of her
arrival was over, she looked very much as she had done
in the wards at St. Phillip&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>But there were no allusions made to the past. John
talked of Brighton, and of the theaters they had gone
to in town, and to all outward seeming this first evening
at Woodlea might have been an ordinary home-coming
of a young couple from their bridal tour. But
hidden in the hearts of the three present was the
knowledge that this was not so. The storm was over,
but its trace was there.</p>

<p>And the next morning a little incident occurred,
which struck a somewhat chill feeling into May&rsquo;s
heart. Breakfast was just over, and as John Temple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
rose from the table, he said pleasantly, looking at Mrs.
Temple:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how are you two going to amuse yourselves
to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In any manner you like, or that Mrs. John Temple
likes,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do not mind, John,&rdquo; said May, rather quickly,
&ldquo;I should like to go over to Woodside this morning to
see my father, as I think he will expect me to do so.
And,&rdquo; she added, with rather a wistful little smile, looking
up in his face, &ldquo;I hope you will come with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But John Temple&rsquo;s brow clouded, and he slightly
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is a luxury which I
am really not prepared to encounter. And why be in
such a hurry to go over to Woodside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think my father would be disappointed if I did
not go,&rdquo; answered May, gently, but her face flushed
and her eyes fell; &ldquo;but I can go alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you had better drive over,&rdquo; said John Temple.
&ldquo;And what would you like to do, Rachel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you feel in the humor for a ride?&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Temple. &ldquo;It is a fine morning; suppose we have a ride,
John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; what time shall I order the carriage and
the horses then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we say eleven?&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple, and she
looked at May, but May&rsquo;s eyes were still cast down.
They, however, settled it thus, and when May returned
to the morning-room about an hour later, she found
Mrs. Temple already there, dressed in her habit, and
John Temple talking to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope May is not disappointed because I do not
care to go to Woodside?&rdquo; John was saying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She could not expect you to do so,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
Temple, just as May entered the room.</p>

<p>She heard the words, and somehow felt that they had
been talking of her. But when a few minutes later the
carriage and the riding-horses came round John Temple
led his young wife to the carriage and handed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
in, and nodded smilingly to her as he was turning
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you any message for my father?&rdquo; said May,
bending forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything you like,&rdquo; answered John, still smiling;
and then he went back to the house, and May was
driven in state to her old home.</p>

<p>And the arrival at Woodside of one of the Hall carriages,
drawn by two handsome horses, with their black
rosetted heads, and the servants also in mourning for
their late master, naturally created quite a sensation at
the homestead. Mr. Churchill was not in the house at
the time, but one of the grooms hastily went in search
of him to the stables. As for Mrs. Churchill, she no
sooner heard that her stepdaughter was in the house
than she hurried upstairs to change her dress, though
she had previously determined to make no difference in
her manner to May.</p>

<p>But the two prancing horses outside and the handsome
carriage influenced her in spite of herself. She
went into the drawing-room quite in a flutter, to find
May standing there looking a little pensively around.
What she had gone through since she had been in this
room May was thinking. But Mrs. Churchill&rsquo;s effusive
welcome interrupted her reflections.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, welcome home,&rdquo; said Mrs. Churchill,
and she kissed her stepdaughter as she had never
kissed her before. &ldquo;We heard you had arrived at the
Hall last night, and your father was hoping that you
could come over to see us this morning; and it&rsquo;s very
good of you to have done so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am very pleased to come,&rdquo; answered May,
with her sweet smile. &ldquo;And the boys; how are the
boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are very well, my dear. They are both at
school this morning, but they are looking forward to
seeing you. They have talked of nothing else since
your father was in London last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have brought them each a present,&rdquo; said May,
&ldquo;and I hope they will like them. Will you give my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
kind love to them both? The presents are in the
carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment Mr. Churchill hurried into the room
and caught his fair daughter in his strong arms, and
kissed her vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, May, my pet, and how are you? More like a
Mayflower than ever, eh, May?&rdquo; he added, holding May
a little apart from him, and looking at her with eyes
brimful of pride and pleasure. &ldquo;Well, my girl, welcome
to your new home! It&rsquo;s kind of you to come over
to see your old father the very first day you have spent
at the Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear father, of course I came,&rdquo; said May, gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And madam? She is still there, I hear; but remember,
May, you&rsquo;re mistress now, so don&rsquo;t be put upon by
any of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! she is very kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kind! I should think so; why should she not be
kind? But you&rsquo;re the squire&rsquo;s wife, you know, now,
May, and you must show her that you quite understand
this. And how is your husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is looking much better again; he has gone out
for a ride with Mrs. Temple this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Well, you should ride with him yourself,
May. No one has a smarter seat on horseback than
you, and I&rsquo;d let them all see this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And during the rest of May&rsquo;s visit Mr. Churchill constantly
harped on this point. She was to assert herself,
but May knew that, even had she wished to do so, she
would have found it very difficult.</p>

<p>For the night before, when they were alone, John
Temple had spoken to his wife on the subject of Mrs.
Temple&rsquo;s position in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, May,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;I came here and
became heir of this property under very peculiar circumstances.
I stepped into the place of Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s
only child, and therefore I feel that to disturb her in
any way as mistress of the house, where she would have
remained mistress had her boy lived, would be at once
ungentlemanly and ungrateful of me. This is why I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
took her to the head of the table to-night, and I am
sure you have the good taste and the good feeling to
understand my wishes on the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then is she going to live here always?&rdquo; May ventured
to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will live here, of course, as long as she wishes
to do so. She is my uncle&rsquo;s widow, and this was his
home, and I wish her to feel that it is still her home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus May had her own position clearly defined to
her. And as she listened to her father&rsquo;s advice she had
no idea of acting on it. But she did not tell him this;
she parted with him affectionately, and Mr. Churchill
was a proud man as he led her to her carriage and
handed her in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring your stepmother some day over to dine
with you, May,&rdquo; he said, before he parted with his
daughter. &ldquo;I want to see you in your own house; fix
some day with your husband for us to come. And now
good-by, my pet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, when May was gone, he returned to the house
in a very boastful mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s lovely, isn&rsquo;t she, Sarah?&rdquo; he remarked to his
wife. &ldquo;But I gave her a bit of advice about madam;
madam must be taught her place, and I&rsquo;ll see that she
is too.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But in the days that followed May was made to feel
more than once that Mrs. Temple exercised a considerable
influence over her husband&rsquo;s mind. John Temple
was always kind to May, always gentle, but he had
fallen back into that easy-going frame of mind which
had been habitual to him before he was aroused from
it by his bitter remorse and self-reproach. Now, he
thought, everything was right for his &ldquo;little May.&rdquo; He
had made her his wife; he bought her a pony-carriage
for herself, and two handsome ponies, so that she could
drive wherever she wished, and he allowed her plenty
of money, and did not object to her spending it lavishly
among the poor and sick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what suffering and sickness is now, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
know, John,&rdquo; she one day said to him, a little wistfully;
but John did not encourage her to talk on the subject.
He, in fact, totally ignored, and tried to forget, the miserable
time after May had left him. It disturbed him
to think of it, and John Temple did not love unpleasant
thoughts.</p>

<p>Thus weeks passed away, and May, with her sweet
reasonableness of conduct, had almost won some sort of
regard from the woman who was yet jealous of her,
when one morning May received a letter from her
father, plainly expressing a wish that he and his wife
should be asked to dine at the Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks so odd to other people, you know, my dear,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;and I hope you will not allow anyone to cast
a slight on your own father,&rdquo; and so on.</p>

<p>This letter disturbed May exceedingly, for she knew
John Temple would not like to receive Mrs. Churchill
at his table, and that Mrs. Temple also strongly objected
to the whole family. Once she had had her two young
brothers to spend the day with her at the Hall, and
Mrs. Temple on that occasion had refused to appear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, you know, May, my dear,&rdquo; John had
said to her afterward; &ldquo;Rachel has a strong and natural
objection to the boys on account of the death of
her own lad in the game where they were playing. So
don&rsquo;t ask them again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May had never done so, though she knew they
thought it was unkind of her. She took them presents
and gave them money, but she dare not ask them to the
Hall. And now about her father and stepmother she
knew not what to do.</p>

<p>At last she took courage and went to her husband,
and put her father&rsquo;s letter in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to ask them so much, John,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>John read the letter, shrugged his shoulders, and
then put his hand kindly on his wife&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be an awful bore, little woman,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just for once, John,&rdquo; pleaded May, and John Temple
finally allowed the invitation to be sent.</p>

<p>But May never wished for her stepmother to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
asked to dine at the Hall again. Mrs. Churchill went
determined to show&mdash;to use one of her husband&rsquo;s
phrase&mdash;that &ldquo;she was as good as any of them.&rdquo; She
went overdressed, to be received by her stepdaughter
and Mrs. Temple both in black, and Mrs. Temple took
a malicious pleasure in leading her on to make herself
ridiculous.</p>

<p>John Temple fidgeted in his chair, but Mrs. Temple
enjoyed his discomfiture. She wished to make him feel
what sort of family he had married into, and she certainly
succeeded in her design. In fact the dinner was
a most uncomfortable one, and only Mrs. Temple was
amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear May, please never ask that good lady here
again,&rdquo; said John Temple, after his father-in-law and
his wife had taken their departure; &ldquo;I really can not
stand her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Churchill to her
spouse, as they drove home together after the entertainment
was over, &ldquo;that a more stupid evening I
never spent; it seems to me that May can scarcely be
called the mistress of her own house, with Mrs. Temple
sitting at the head of the table, and that kind of thing.
However, we&rsquo;ve dined there, and the neighbors can&rsquo;t
say we&rsquo;ve not, and we need not tell them it was anything
but pleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Mr. Churchill, who was also much
disappointed, &ldquo;I think it is a pity May does not make
more of herself. However, Mr. John Temple is my
landlord as well as my son-in-law, so we must just make
the best of things.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XLV.<br />

<small>ANOTHER HEIR.</small></h2>


<p>A whole year passed away after May&rsquo;s arrival at the
Hall as John Temple&rsquo;s wife; a year with its chances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
and changes, when it became known in the neighborhood
that it was hoped an heir was about to be born to
Woodlea.</p>

<p>The prospect of this event pleased John Temple
greatly, but displeased Mrs. Temple. She did not wish
this new and tender tie to draw closer the two she fain
would part. But she was, of course, obliged to conceal
her feelings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I hope,&rdquo; she one day said smiling to John Temple,
&ldquo;that when the interesting event comes off that
your charming mother-in-law will not take up her abode
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Temple laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! nonsense,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;May would not care to
have her here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Churchill had, however, already hinted to May
that she would like to be present, but May had her own
ideas on the subject, and she accordingly acted on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John, may I invite Miss Webster to be with me
when baby is born?&rdquo; she said to her husband, and John
Temple immediately assented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear, invite whoever you like,&rdquo; he
answered, kindly. &ldquo;Yes, I think Miss Webster would
be a very good person for you to have with you; she is
a motherly woman, though she has never been a
mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, dear John,&rdquo; replied May; &ldquo;I shall be so
glad if she will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange Webster will never come here,&rdquo; went on
John Temple; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked him three times, you know,
May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a busy man, I suppose; then I will write
to Miss Webster to-day, John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And May did write, and Miss Webster accepted the
invitation. Both the sisters had been previously asked
to Woodlea, but an illness of Miss Eliza&rsquo;s had prevented
their going. Now, however, Miss Eliza was well enough
to be left, and Miss Webster wrote that she looked forward
with sincere pleasure &ldquo;again to kiss the sweet
face&rdquo; she &ldquo;so often thought of.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>May also was truly delighted to see once more the
kindly woman under whose hospitable roof she had
once spent such bright hours of hope and happiness.
She drove to the station to meet Miss Webster. She
showed her, with modest pride, all the tiny treasures
she had prepared, and in which Mrs. Temple had no
interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is Mr. Webster?&rdquo; she asked, shortly after
Miss Webster arrived.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ralph is very well, I think, and desired to be
remembered to you. But he works too hard, I tell him;
he is rising rapidly at the bar, and has more briefs
offered to him than he can possibly accept. And I
believe he is going to try to get into Parliament at the
next election.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; said May, quietly. But she sighed
softly as she turned away. She was thinking of Ralph
Webster, and her great debt to him which she could
never pay.</p>

<p>But a day or two after Miss Webster&rsquo;s arrival at the
Hall, something so terrible occurred that for many weeks
May&rsquo;s life was as a bewildered dream. It happened
so suddenly that the blow fell with crushing force, and
it was well for May that she had by her side one so sincere
and faithful as her old friend.</p>

<p>They had all lunched together, and John Temple had
been in one of his brightest moods. He was going to
ride after lunch, and when his horse came round May
followed him into the hall to see him mount. And as
she stood there&mdash;looking a little wan perhaps, but
with her sweet, serene face raised to his&mdash;a sudden
impulse of affection induced John Temple to stoop
down and kiss her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care of yourself, little woman,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
so glad you have Miss Webster with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May smiled, and thus they parted. She was feeling
a little tired, and Miss Webster therefore advised her to
go to her room and lie down, and in a little while she
fell into a placid sleep.</p>

<p>In the meantime John Temple was riding quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
along the country lanes, with the hedge-rows on either
side green with the hues of the spring-time. And for
no particular purpose, when he reached the outskirts of
Henley Wood he turned his horse toward the road
through it, admiring placidly as he went the trees just
budding into leafage.</p>

<p>It was a peaceful scene, and there was no disturbing
element in John Temple&rsquo;s mind, when suddenly there
sprang from behind the trunk of one of the great oaks
the figure of a man.</p>

<p>John turned his head to look at this man, and in a
moment recognized him. It was Tom Henderson of
Stourton Grange, but a terrible change had passed over
the young man&rsquo;s face; and in an instant it flashed
across John&rsquo;s mind that he had heard that Tom Henderson
had been, or was, mad.</p>

<p>And he could not doubt this now. Henderson stood
straight before him on the roadway, brandishing a
huge, heavy, oaken bludgeon, which he had probably
cut from one of the neighboring trees. And as John
Temple approached nearer, with a frightful yell he
sprang forward toward him, and struck a severe blow
on the head of John&rsquo;s horse.</p>

<p>The horse reared, and John lashed the madman with
his riding-whip, which was his only means of defense.
But with a hoarse scream of rage Henderson now closed
with him, striking him also on the head with his murderous
weapon, and John reeled from his saddle and
fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got my revenge!&rdquo; shrieked Henderson.
&ldquo;You who spoilt my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time, however, John Temple had regained
his feet, and a fierce struggle ensued between the two
men. John was blinded by the blood flowing from the
wound on his brow, but still he fought bravely for his
life. They wound their arms round each other; they
tore, they strained, but Henderson was a more heavily
built man than John Temple, and his madness gave
him unnatural strength. Finally he forced John down
on the ground below him, and struck him with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
clenched fist, once more on the head. John Temple&rsquo;s
arms relaxed their grasp; a deadly faintness stole over
him, and Henderson gave a hideous laugh. He had
won the fight, and he rose triumphant and spurned his
enemy with his foot; and then drawing his pocket-knife
from his coat, plunged it into John Temple&rsquo;s breast.</p>

<p>He had scarcely done the murderous deed when he
heard hurried footsteps approaching down the roadway,
and he at once turned and fled. It was his keeper,
from whose care he had escaped, and the man had
come out to seek him. The keeper, horrified, now came
on John Temple&rsquo;s prostrate body. He knelt down, he
raised the head, and for a moment or two longer John
Temple lived.</p>

<p>He breathed once or twice; he whispered one word&mdash;&ldquo;May&mdash;&rdquo;
he murmured, and as the name lingered on
his lips he died.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Late in the afternoon May awoke from her placid
sleep. She had been dreaming, poor child, but not of
the dark tragedy that had been enacted in Henley
Wood. Yet she awoke with a start and sat up, and
then distinctly heard loud, piercing screams of grief
ringing through the house. She at once hastily rose,
and was approaching the door of her bedroom when it
opened, and Miss Webster&rsquo;s gentle face appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Webster, someone is crying so dreadfully;
what is it?&rdquo; asked May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been an accident, my dear,&rdquo; faltered Miss
Webster, who was very pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An accident?&rdquo; repeated May, alarmed. &ldquo;What
has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your husband&mdash;Mr. Temple, has been thrown from
his horse,&rdquo; answered Miss Webster in an agitated voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John! Oh! where is he?&rdquo; cried May, and her face
grew very white. &ldquo;I will go to him at once,&rdquo; and she
grasped Miss Webster&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dear, you can not go just now,&rdquo; said Miss
Webster, soothingly; &ldquo;you can not see him just now&mdash;you
must think of the child, May&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>A cry burst from May&rsquo;s pale lips, and she looked
eagerly in Miss Webster&rsquo;s face, which was full of pity
and distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me the worst!&rdquo; gasped May. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;see&mdash;Oh!
God! it can not be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear&mdash;&rdquo; began Miss Webster, and then her
kindly lips refused their office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me&mdash;&rdquo; repeated May, huskily, &ldquo;is he&mdash;is he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, he has passed away from all earthly
troubles,&rdquo; answered Miss Webster, in broken accents;
&ldquo;he has been thrown from his horse and his head
injured&mdash;but May, my dear, my dear, you have a duty
before you&mdash;be brave, and bear this great blow for
your child&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But with a moan May sank prone upon the floor;
and as she did so the frantic cries of Mrs. Temple still
sounded in her ears!</p>

<p>Miss Webster at once rang the bell violently, and a
moment or two later the doctor appeared. It had been
known in the household that Miss Webster had gone to
break the news to the poor widow, and there were
anxious listeners waiting outside. Among these were
Mr. Churchill and the doctor, who had been hastily
summoned after John Temple&rsquo;s death, and who had
accompanied the body to the Hall. He now&mdash;assisted
by Miss Webster&mdash;lifted May on the bed, and he also
spoke to May very impressively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear madam, think of your unborn child; you
may irreparably injure it unless you control your grief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And May understood. She lay there with her white
face and her wide-open eyes trying to keep calm. She
had looked forward to her motherhood, thinking it
would fill a strange void in her heart, and she struggled
now as bravely as she could with her bitter pain.</p>

<p>That night her child was born; born amid such
anguish that for long hours they scarcely hoped the
young mother would survive. But when the pale
spring dawn crept through the window-blinds the early
beams fell on the small, pinched features of the little
heir of Woodlea. They fell too on the pale, handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
face of the dead father; on the face of John Temple
lying in his unbroken sleep.</p>

<p>May was ill for many weeks after this. She had
fever, and was happily unconscious when the inquest
was held on her husband&rsquo;s body. And at this inquest
the miserable mother of the madman Henderson was
forced to appear. She gave her evidence in a broken,
faltering voice, telling those present that her son had
never recovered from the effects of a blow he had
received from the late Mr. John Temple; that he had
had brain fever, and that for some time afterward his
reason was completely overthrown, and he had been
confined in a lunatic asylum. Lately, however, he had
appeared to be so much better that she had brought
him home, though one of the keepers from the asylum
accompanied him.</p>

<p>This man then stated that Mr. Henderson had
appeared perfectly well and sane during lunch on the
day of the murder, but that he afterward suddenly
missed him, and at once started out to seek him, and
was horrified by finding Mr. John Temple&rsquo;s body lying
on the roadway with Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s pocket knife
thrust in his breast. He said Mr. Temple was not quite
dead when he found him, but expired a few moments
later. He also stated that when Henderson was recaptured
that he was in a state of raging madness, and
boasted constantly of his murderous deed; and that he
was now once more confined in the asylum.</p>

<p>All these terrible details May was mercifully spared,
and she never knew the ghastly truth about John
Temple&rsquo;s death. He had been killed by a fall from his
horse, she was told, and Miss Webster, and Miss Eliza,
who had now joined her sister, took good care she
heard nothing more.</p>

<p>These two good ladies indeed watched over her with
the most devoted affection during the long days of her
illness. And to their great delight the child throve, and
by and by May would look sometimes in the baby&rsquo;s
face and smile. As for Mr. Churchill his pride and
pleasure in the little heir was unbounded. He brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
his wife to the Hall to see him, and boasted, it
must be confessed, a good deal of the babe&rsquo;s future
possessions.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mrs. Temple had left the Hall. Her
violent grief at John Temple&rsquo;s sudden death was
characteristic of her nature, and everything painfully
reminded her of him. She hated, too, the &ldquo;baby
worship,&rdquo; as she called it, of the two maiden sisters,
and once or twice Mr. Churchill had somewhat plainly
hinted in her presence that when May recovered that,
as the mother of the heir of Woodlea, she ought to act
as mistress of the house.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Temple went away, and her absence was a
relief to May, and indeed to the whole household. May
could see her father and brothers when she wished now;
and at her earnest request the Misses Webster stayed on
with her during the whole summer. They used to talk
to her sometimes of &ldquo;dear Ralph,&rdquo; but the autumn was
far advanced, and John Temple had lain in his grave
six months, before Ralph Webster saw again the woman
he had befriended in her bitter need.</p>

<p>He came quite unexpectedly&mdash;at least to May&mdash;one
October afternoon, when the three ladies were sitting
together in the stately, old-fashioned garden of the Hall.
The leaves were floating downward from the trees, but
the air was scarcely chill. It was like a summer day,
yet the tints and hues of the fading year were stamped
on flower and leaf. And somehow May was thinking
of this, of the change which comes to every living
thing, when the sound of a firm step on the gravel
behind the seat where she was sitting, made her raise
her head and look around.</p>

<p>And the two sisters did the same thing, at the same
instant, and then started to their feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ralph!&rdquo; they both cried, and hastily went forward
to meet their nephew with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>But May only rose; a strange nervousness came over
her; seeing Ralph Webster again recalled so much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you pardon my intrusion?&rdquo; he asked a moment
later, as he took her hand in his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;I&mdash;I am very glad&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered in
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As my aunts have entirely forsaken me,&rdquo; went on
Webster with a smile, &ldquo;I thought I might venture to
look them up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have often talked of you, my dear,&rdquo; said kind
Miss Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, often,&rdquo; sighed Miss Eliza.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;am afraid I have been very selfish, but I would
not let them leave me,&rdquo; continued May, with more self-possession.
&ldquo;I am very glad to see you here, Mr.
Webster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said these simple words he raised his eyes and
looked in her fair face, and it seemed more fair to him
even than he had thought it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have often thought of coming,&rdquo; he said, in a low
tone; and a faint blush stole to May&rsquo;s cheeks as he
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had better go into the house now,&rdquo; she suggested,
the next moment, looking at Miss Webster.
&ldquo;Mr. Webster will be tired with his journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus they all returned to the Hall together, and the
first awkwardness of the meeting was over. Ralph
Webster stayed to dinner and remained all night, but
when he proposed to leave the next morning, May asked
him to spend another day with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you not spare us another day?&rdquo; she said,
smiling.</p>

<p>Webster thought he could spare many, but he did not
say this. He, however, accepted the invitation, and
May and Aunt Eliza took him a long walk through the
park, and as they trod the mossy paths somehow both
May and Webster were very silent. But Aunt Eliza
was unusually loquacious, and carried on the conversation
with scarcely any assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems almost like the delightful old days when
May was with us at Pembridge Terrace, does it not,
Ralph?&rdquo; said the good lady at length, with a total
absence of tact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Webster, briefly; and for a moment
his brow clouded.</p>

<p>But presently it cleared again, and no further allusion
was made to bygone times. Nor did Webster during
this visit make any allusion to the unchanged feelings
of his heart. They parted as friends part, who know
and feel the truth of that much-belied word. May
knew how true a friend Ralph Webster had been to her,
how unselfish and self-sacrificing, and she had not forgotten
that parting before her second marriage with
poor John Temple. She had understood something of
his true feelings then, and perhaps a subtle instinct told
her he was not one to change. And before he went, he
promised to return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come down for Christmas?&rdquo; he said, and May
softly answered, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when Christmas came, a snowy Christmas, when
all the outside world was white, and at the Hall the
laurels and fir-trees were weighed down with the frozen
rain, and the gates blocked with the sloping drifts,
Webster arrived.</p>

<p>His aunts hurried into the hall to welcome the chilled
traveler, and a little behind them stood the gracious
black-clad figure for whom Webster&rsquo;s eyes eagerly
sought. Then May also went forward with a welcoming
smile, and the two clasped each other&rsquo;s hands and
exchanged good wishes, and Webster knew they were
no empty words.</p>

<p>He arrived on Christmas Eve, and May had her two
young brothers staying with her, and the boys had
made the hall and the rooms bright with holly. Their
presence, too, made the house more cheerful, for their
young voices rang with the tones that had known no
grief. Webster was soon on the most friendly terms
with them, and the next morning went with them out
amongst the snow, and came back, his fond aunts
declared, &ldquo;looking quite like a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was not the snow nor the frost that made Webster&rsquo;s
eyes bright and glad. It was a sort of inward
consciousness that the fair woman he loved was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
utterly indifferent to him. Yet he never had an opportunity
of speaking to her alone. Mr. and Mrs. Churchill
came to dinner, and as Mr. Churchill sat opposite his
daughter at the foot of the table it seemed to him that
his cup of prosperity was nearly full, and he could not
resist glancing occasionally, somewhat triumphantly, at
his wife, who on the whole felt rather subdued.</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill also invited Webster over to Woodside
on the following day, but he declined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am leaving to-morrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My brief holiday
will soon be ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But before he left he spoke the words to May that he
had been intending to say. They were standing
together in the afternoon, gazing out on the snowy
landscape, when he turned round and looked steadfastly
at her sweet, pensive face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be leaving in less than an hour, May,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Will you give me something to take away with
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I give you?&rdquo; asked May, in a low tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me hope,&rdquo; answered Webster; &ldquo;the hope that
some day I may win what to me is the dearest gift of
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May did not speak. Her head dropped, and she
slightly turned it aside, but Webster could, still see the
delicate profile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know how long I have wished this,&rdquo; went on
Webster, earnestly; &ldquo;almost from the first time I saw
you I loved you&mdash;we were parted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush,&rdquo; said May, in a low, trembling voice,
&ldquo;it is too soon to speak of such a thing&mdash;even to think
of it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can not help thinking of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;can never repay you,&rdquo; continued May in
faltering accents. &ldquo;Do not think I forget because I
do not speak of the past&mdash;but for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can repay me a hundred-fold, if there were
anything to repay, which there is not, by giving me,
before I leave you, the hope, even the faintest hope,
that you will not quite forget me in my absence.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can never forget you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Webster stooped down and kissed her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the present I will try to be content, then,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;but remember, May, that I think of you every
day and hour of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing more was said at the time; one of the boys
rushed into the room, wanting, of course, something
from his sister, and May was never again alone with
Webster until he left. But she did not forget his
words. In the spring she went up to town for a short
visit to Miss Webster, and there she saw him constantly
and at last&mdash;after a year of widowhood&mdash;she
promised &ldquo;some day&rdquo; to be his wife.</p>

<p>But two whole years passed after John Temple&rsquo;s
tragic death before she would consent to marry. By
this time Webster had entered Parliament, having
won one of the by-elections, and in his profession he was
striding on apace. A busy, active, ambitious man; strong
and faithful in all things, and most faithful to his love.</p>

<p>They were married by Mr. Layton, but Mrs. Layton
could scarcely suppress the bitterness of her tongue on
the occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a lord the next time,&rdquo; she whispered to
one of the spectators; but from motives of prudence
the moment the ceremony was over, she rushed up to
the newly-married pair and heartily congratulated
them.</p>

<p>As for the Misses Webster, they were so overjoyed
that they wept copiously&mdash;especially Miss Eliza&mdash;during
the whole of the marriage service. Then they
too hurried up to kiss the sweet, grave face of the
bride, and May tenderly embraced them both.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been my truest friends,&rdquo; she whispered,
&ldquo;except Ralph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill was also delighted with the match, and
now superintends the whole of his young grandson&rsquo;s
property, receiving, we may be sure, a handsome
income for doing so. The boys, too, are having first-rate
educations, and the whole family are prosperous
and well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And my poor daughter is now here,&rdquo; sometimes Mrs.
Layton thinks bitterly, sighing over the remembrance
of the good things she used to obtain from the Hall in
the old squire&rsquo;s time. But Mrs. Temple never returned
to Woodlea, though May invited her to do so. She
married an officer, and went out to India with her husband;
and on the rare occasions that she does write to
her mother she never mentions &ldquo;the new people,&rdquo; as
Mrs. Layton calls them, at Woodlea Hall. Nor does
she inquire after &ldquo;the heir,&rdquo; perhaps not having quite
forgotten the time when she waited and watched for
the coming of poor John Temple!</p>
